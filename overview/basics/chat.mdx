The Chat interface is a conversational experience with your AI agents. 
You'll see this if you send a natural language message to Onyx! 

<Tip>
  You can force Onyx to show the Chat interface by clicking the Auto / Search / Chat toggle in the top left corner.

## How to use the Chat Interface
<Steps>
    <Step title="Type your message in the Onyx Unified Interface input bar" icon="pen-to-square">
        You can try asking Onyx "What data do you have access to?"

        You can finely control how Onyx responds using the input bar options. Don't worry, we'll cover this in more detail [below](#configure-your-chat-session).

    </Step>
    <Step title="Onyx will begin processing your request" icon="gears">
        You'll see Onyx plan, reason, or invoke any Actions available to the AI Agent you're using. If you sent an easy question, Onyx may respond instantly!

    </Step>
    <Step title="The AI responds conversationally" icon="pen-to-square">
        The default Onyx AI Agent is equipped with Search. This means it can consult your organization's data sources to answer your question.

        If Search is invoked, you'll see a list of results in the right panel. Additionally, the AI will cite the sources it used in its response.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Continue your conversation or ask something new!" icon="pen-to-square">
        Send a follow up question, instruct the Agent to do something with your docs, or ask something completely new.

    </Step>
    <Step title="After sending your message" icon="pen-to-square">
        Your conversation will be saved in the History list of the Side Panel.
        
        <Info>
            Your admin may set a retention policy for your History that will automatically delete old conversations.

### Selecting an Agent
In the Side Panel, you will find the Agents available in your Onyx deployment. Onyx comes with 3 default Agents:
- **Search**: This Agent is equipped with the Search Action. This means it can consult your organization's data sources to answer your question.
- **General**: This Agent does not come equipped with any Actions. Use this to just chat with an LLM.
- **Art**: This Agent is equipped with the Art Action, which allows you to generate images using your organization's Vision model.
