### How do I know if Onyx has the right information?

## Using Agents

### How do I choose the right agent?
Use the agent selector to switch between different AI agents. Each agent may specialize in different topics or have access to specific knowledge bases.

### Can I create my own agents?
Custom agent creation is typically handled by administrators. Contact your IT team or Onyx administrator to request new specialized agents.

### Why do different agents give different answers?
Agents may have access to different knowledge sources or be configured with different expertise areas, leading to varying responses based on their specialized knowledge.

## Search and Knowledge

### Why can't Onyx find information I know exists?
The document might not be connected to Onyx yet, or it might be in a data source that your selected agent doesn't have access to. Try different agents or contact your administrator.

### How recent is the information Onyx provides?
This depends on how frequently your data sources are synced. Most sources update regularly, but check with your administrator for specific sync schedules.

### Can I upload my own files?
Yes! You can upload files directly in the chat interface for analysis and questions.

## Privacy and Security

### Is my conversation history private?
Yes, your conversations are private to your account and encrypted. Only you can see your chat history unless you explicitly share it.

### What data can Onyx access?
Onyx only accesses data sources that have been connected by your organization's administrators. It respects all existing access controls and permissions.

### Can I delete my conversations?
Yes, you can delete individual conversations or clear your entire chat history at any time.

## Technical Issues

### What should I do if Onyx isn't responding?
Try refreshing the page, checking your internet connection, or logging out and back in. If issues persist, contact your IT support team.

### Why are responses sometimes slow?
Complex questions, large file uploads, or high system usage can slow response times. Onyx processes information thoroughly to provide accurate answers.

### Can I use Onyx offline?
No, Onyx requires an internet connection to access your organization's knowledge base and generate responses.

## Advanced Features

### How do I give feedback on answers?

## Getting Help
