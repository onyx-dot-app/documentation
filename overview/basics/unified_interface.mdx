## Overview

Your experience with Onyx starts in the Unified Interface. From here, you can search your docs, generate code, instruct your Agents to do work, and more.

You can talk to Onyx like you would talk to a colleague. Or, you can perform a search like you would in Google.

## Chat vs. Search

Sometimes you want to converse with an AI assistant to get an AI summary, revise your writing, or get help with a task. Othertimes, you just want to find a doc you know is in the system.

<Tip>Onyx automatically determines your intent based on the first message you send.</Tip>

You'll see the Unified Interface magically transform into the Chat or Search Interface. Don't worry! You can always switch between the two interfaces or force Onyx to only use one.
