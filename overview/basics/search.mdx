Onyx's search goes far beyond simple keyword matching. It understands the meaning behind your queries and finds relevant information even when the exact words don't match.

## How Search Works

### **Semantic Understanding**
Onyx doesn't just look for exact word matches. It understands concepts and context, so searching for "time off" will find information about "vacation policy" and "PTO guidelines."

### **Intelligent Ranking**
Results are ranked not just by keyword relevance, but by how well they actually answer your question. More recent, authoritative, and contextually relevant information appears first.

### **Multi-Source Integration**
Search looks across all your connected data sources simultaneously - documents, Chat messages, tickets, wikis, and more - giving you a comprehensive view.

## Search Methods

### **Direct Search**
Use the search bar to find specific information:
- Enter keywords, phrases, or questions
- Results appear with snippets and source information
- Click through to see full documents

### **Conversational Search**
Ask questions in the Chat interface:
- Onyx searches automatically when you ask questions
- Get summarized answers with citations
- Perfect for when you need interpreted results, not just raw documents

## Search Tips

### **Use Natural Language**
- Instead of: "vacation policy PTO days"
- Try: "How many vacation days do I get per year?"

### **Be Specific When Needed**
- Add context: "vacation policy for remote employees"
- Include timeframes: "recent updates to the expense policy"
- Specify departments: "engineering team meeting notes"

### **Try Different Approaches**
If you don't find what you need:
- Rephrase your query with different words
- Break complex questions into simpler parts
- Try broader or more specific terms

## Understanding Results

### **Source Information**
Each result shows:
- Which system it came from (Slack, Google Drive, etc.)
- When it was created or last updated
- Who created it (if available)

### **Access Permissions**
You'll only see results for information you have permission to access in the original systems. This maintains your organization's security while giving you comprehensive search.

### **Result Types**
Different types of content are clearly indicated:
- **Documents**: PDFs, Word docs, Google Docs
- **Messages**: Slack posts, Teams chats, emails
- **Issues**: Jira tickets, GitHub issues
- **Pages**: Wiki pages, Confluence articles

## Advanced Features

### **Filters**
Narrow down results by:
- Date ranges
- Source systems
- Content types
- Authors or teams

### **Saved Searches**
Save frequently used searches for quick access to regularly needed information.

### **Search History**
Revisit previous searches to find information you've looked for before.
