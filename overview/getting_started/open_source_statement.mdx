## Our Mission

We believe every team should have access to the power of Generative AI with their organizational knowledge.
As large language models become increasingly available,
Onyx serves as the bridge between powerful AI capabilities and your team's needs.

More than just another Chat interface, Onyx unlocks AI's full potential for knowledge discovery, intelligent reasoning,
and real work.

## Why Open Source?

<Card title="Security" icon="shield-check">
  Your AI platform should be as secure as your most critical business applications.
  That's why Onyx is fully transparent, SOC2 Type 2 compliant, and can be completely air-gapped.

  Have peace of mind knowing exactly how your data is processed and stored within the boundaries of your Onyx
  deployment.
</Card>

<Card title="Flexibility" icon="puzzle-piece">
  Generative AI is becoming a critical piece of a modern company's strategy, operations, and technology.
  We want to offer the most flexible and future proof 'AI for work' solution.

  We're building Onyx with an emphasis on easy customization.
  Many of our users extend or modify the core application to suit their specific needs.
</Card>

<Card title="Control" icon="hand-fist">
  Onyx is independent from AI providers like Microsoft, Google, or OpenAI. This means you own your AI stack.

  Deploy Onyx in your preferred cloud, on-premise, or in our managed cloud. You decide which models to use,
  what data is sent to these models, and how your users interact with AI. With Onyx, you're not just a user of AI,
  you're in command of it.
</Card>

## Commercial Viability

We're builders at heart, committed to making Onyx valuable for as many people as possible.
To push the boundaries of user experience and AI innovation,
we've assembled a core team of world-class developers who share this vision.

To borrow from Sid Sijbrandij (Co-Founder, GitLab):
> "We need to think in the interests of the project, while tending to the realities of running a business to support it... After all, we know that to sustain the project, we need to make it commercially viable."

We believe in radical transparency—both in how we build open software and in the commercial realities of competing in
this rapidly evolving space.

<Tip>
  Every organization, regardless of size or budget, will always have access to Onyx's core capabilities—including RAG,
  deep research, custom agents, and more—completely free.
</Tip>

For organizations with special requirements—such as usage auditing, granular access controls,
and white-labeling—we offer the Enterprise Edition, available both as a self-hosted solution and through Onyx Cloud.

The Enterprise Edition sustains our mission, enabling us to keep the vast majority of Onyx's features free and open for everyone.
