## Our Mission

We believe every team should have access to the power of Generative AI with their organizational knowledge. As large language models become increasingly available, Onyx serves as the bridge between powerful AI capabilities and your team's needs.

More than just another Chat interface, Onyx unlocks AI's full potential for knowledge discovery, intelligent reasoning, and real work.

## Why Open Source?

<Card title="Security" icon="shield-check">
  Your AI platform should be as secure as your most critical business applications. That's why Onyx is fully transparent, SOC2 Type 2 compliant, and can be completely air-gapped. 
  
  Have peace of mind knowing exactly how your data is processed and stored within the boundaries of your Onyx deployment.
</Card>

<Card title="Flexibility" icon="puzzle-piece">
  Generative AI is becoming a critical piece of a modern company's strategy, operations, and technology. We want to offer the most flexible and future proof 'AI for work' solution. 
  
  We're building Onyx with an emphasis on easy customization. Many of our users extend or modify the core application to suit their specific needs.
</Card>

<Card title="Control" icon="hand-fist">
  Onyx is independent from AI providers like Microsoft, Google, or OpenAI. This means you own your AI stack. 
  
  Deploy Onyx in your preferred cloud, on-premise, or in our managed cloud. You decide which models to use, what data is sent to these models, and how your users interact with AI. With Onyx, you're not just a user of AI, you're in command of it.
</Card>

## Commercial Viability

We are a team of builders and we want as many people as possible to find value from Onyx. To innovate on the cutting edge of user experience and AI features, we maintain a core team of world-class developers. 

As Sid from GitLab once said:
> "we need to think in the interests of the project, while tending to the realities of running a business to support itâ€¦ After all, we know that to sustain the project, we need to make it commercially viable."

We will always maintain complete transparency about building open software and the commercial requirements needed to keep pace with this rapidly evolving space. 

<Note> Regardless of the size or budget of your organization, you will always be able to deploy Onyx with its core features such as RAG, custom agents, and internet search. </Note>

For larger enterprises that have unique requirements, like auditing usage, fine-grain access controls, and whitelabeling, we provide the Enterprise Edition[link to EE page] (our commercial offering), which can be self-hosted or used through Onyx Cloud.

The Enterprise Edition keeps our doors open, and allows us offer the vast majority of our features for free.
