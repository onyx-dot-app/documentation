The Chat interface is a conversational experience with your AI agents.
You'll see this if you send a natural language message to Onyx!

<Tip>
  You can force Onyx to show the Chat interface by clicking the Auto / Search / Chat toggle in the top left corner.
</Tip>

## How to use the Chat Interface

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type your message in the input bar" icon="pen-to-square">
    You can try asking Onyx "What data do you have access to?"

    You can finely control how Onyx responds using the input bar options. Don't worry,
    we'll cover this in more detail [below](#configure-your-chat-session).

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/start_chat.png" alt="Onyx Chat Interface" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Onyx will begin processing your request" icon="gears">
    You'll see Onyx plan, reason, or invoke any Actions available to the AI Agent you're using.
    If you sent an easy question, Onyx may respond instantly!

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/chat_first_message.png" alt="Onyx Chat Interface" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="The AI responds conversationally" icon="pen-to-square">
    The default Onyx AI Agent is equipped with Search.
    This means it can consult your organization's data sources to answer your question.

    If the Search Action is invoked, you'll see a list of results in the right panel. Additionally,
    the AI will cite the sources it used in its response.

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/chat_response.png" alt="Onyx Chat Interface" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue your conversation or ask something new!" icon="pen-to-square">
    Send a follow up question, instruct the Agent to do something with your docs, or ask something completely new.

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/follow_up.png" alt="Onyx Chat Interface" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="After sending your message" icon="pen-to-square">
    Your conversation will be saved in the History list of the Side Panel.

    <Info>
      Your admin may set a retention policy for your History that will automatically delete old conversations.

## Configure your Chat Session

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/chat_options.png" alt="Onyx Chat Input Bar" />

### Selecting an Agent

In the Side Panel, you will find the Agents available in your Onyx deployment. Onyx comes with 3 default Agents:
- **Search**: This Agent is equipped with the Search Action. This means it can consult your
  organization's data sources to answer your question.
- **General**: This Agent does not come equipped with any Actions. Use this to just chat with an
  LLM.
- **Art**: This Agent is equipped with the Art Action, which allows you to generate images using
  your organization's Vision model.

<AgentsPersonasAssistantsNote />

Below your most recently-used Agents, you will find the **More Assistants** button.
Clicking this will display all of your organization's custom Agents published by your Admins and Curators.

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/GENERIC_PLACEHOLDER.png" alt="Onyx More Assistants Button" />

### Choose your Model

Each Agent has a default language model. At any time,
you can change the model for your session by clicking the **Model** dropdown in the input bar.

<Tip>
  Can't find the model you want? Ask your Admin to add it to your Onyx deployment!
</Tip>

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/GENERIC_PLACEHOLDER.png" alt="Onyx Model Dropdown" />

### Thoughtful vs. Fast Responses

Clicking the hourglass icon in the input bar will let you choose between a thoughtful response or a fast response.

**Thoughtful** mode causes the AI to evaluate your question, execute multiple Actions,
and reflect on the results before generating a comprehensive response.

**Fast** mode causes the AI to generate a response as quickly as possible. Agents cannot invoke Actions in Fast mode.

<Note>
  Prefer one over the other? Set you preferred mode in your User Settings!
</Note>

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/GENERIC_PLACEHOLDER.png" alt="Onyx Thoughtful vs. Fast Responses" />

### Filters

If you are chatting with an Agent that has the Search Action,
you can use the filters button to refine the documents available to your Agent.

Click the slider icon in the input bar to open the filters. You can filter by last updated date, Connector source,
Document Sets, and metadata Tags.

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/GENERIC_PLACEHOLDER.png" alt="Onyx Filters" />

### Attach Files

Clicking the plus icon in the input bar will let you upload files to your chat session.
These files are saved in My Documents and are private to you.

## Overview

Your experience with Onyx starts in the Unified Interface. From here, you can search your docs, generate code,
instruct your Agents to do work, and more.

You can talk to Onyx like you would talk to a colleague. Or, you can perform a search like you would in Google.

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/start_chat.png" alt="Onyx Unified Interface Chat" />

## Chat vs. Search vs. Auto

Sometimes you want to converse with an AI assistant to get an AI summary, revise your writing, or get help with a task.
Othertimes, you just want to find a doc you know is in the system.

<Tip>
  Onyx automatically determines your intent based on the first message you send.
</Tip>

After you submit your message, you'll see the Unified Interface magically transform into the Chat or Search Interface.

Don't worry! You can always switch between Search and Chat. Alternatively,
use the dropdown in the top left corner to switch between Auto, Search, and Chat.
