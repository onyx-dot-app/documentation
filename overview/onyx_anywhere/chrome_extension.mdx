Use the Onyx extension to ask questions from anywhere. You can also replace your new-tab page with a custom Onyx page:

- Onyx Search on new tabs
- Favorite website bookmarks
- Onyx as a sidebar to any page in Chrome

<Note>
  In the future,
  the Onyx Chrome Extension will allow you to ask questions about the page you are currently on and optionally index the
  recent pages into the Onyx knowledge base.
  You'll be able to ask questions about recently visited pages via both the extension and the Onyx web app.
