The Web App is the default way to use Onyx and the recommended for the most complete experience.

The admin panel is also a web-app exclusive feature which is the easiest way to manage the
[Agents](/overview/core_features/agents), [Actions](/overview/core_features/actions),
[Connectors](/overview/core_features/connectors), users, settings and more.

<Tip>
  A great place to get familiar with the experience is to start with the [Chat](/overview/core_features/chat)
  overview or the [Admin](/admin/overview) tab for managing the deployment.
</Tip>

If you're deploying Onyx locally (guide [here](/deployment/getting_started/quickstart)),
you should be able to access the Web UI at http://localhost:3000/.
