<Note>
  Currently Onyx is a responsive application and so your Onyx deployment will work on your smartphone or tablet via your
  browser app.

  While is is not as nice of an experience as a native app,
  it can be used in the meantime while the Onyx Mobile App is under development.

## Mobile App
