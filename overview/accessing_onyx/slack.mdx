## Best Practices

### **Ask Clear Questions**
- Be specific: "What's the process for requesting time off?" vs "time off"
- Include context: "How do I update my direct deposit for payroll?"
- Use natural language: Ask like you're talking to a colleague

### **Follow Up**
- Ask for clarification: "Can you explain that in simpler terms?"
- Request different formats: "Can you give me that as a bulleted list?"
- Dive deeper: "What are the specific requirements for that?"

### **Use in the Right Context**
- **DMs**: For personal questions or sensitive topics
- **Team channels**: For questions that benefit everyone
- **Project channels**: For project-specific information
