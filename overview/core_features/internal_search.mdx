The Search interface provides direct access to your organization's knowledge without AI conversation.

<Tip>
  You can force Onyx to show the Search interface by clicking the Auto / Search / Chat toggle in the top left corner.
</Tip>

Onyx's Search Action uses **hybrid search** that combines both keyword matching and semantic understanding.
This means you'll find relevant documents even when they don't contain your exact search terms.

## How to use the Search Interface

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type your query in the input bar" icon="pen-to-square">
    You can try searching for "pto policy" or any keyword-like query.

  </Step>

  <Step title="No AI answer, just results" icon="bolt">
    If the system thinks you're looking for search/internal documents, you'll see results nearly instantly.

    <Note>
      AI-powered features like **Deep Research** and **Thoughtful Mode** are not available in the Search interface.
      These advanced capabilities require the Chat interface where the AI can reason through complex queries and provide
      comprehensive responses.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply post-filters to refine results" icon="sliders">
    Use the filter selections under the input bar to narrow down your results by source, date range, document sets,
    or tags.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert to Chat for AI discussion" icon="comment">
    Want to use the Search results with AI? Convert your search session to Chat by pressing the Convert icon.
    This lets you seamlessly transition to having a conversation about the content you've found.

  </Step>

  <Step title="After sending your query" icon="clock">
    Your search will be saved in the History list of the Side Panel, just like chat conversations.

    <Info>
      Your admin may set a retention policy for your History that will automatically delete old searches.

### Selecting an Agent with Search

The default Onyx Agent comes equipped with Search, allowing it to access your organization's data sources.

<Note>
  Don't see search results? Make sure you have an Agent equipped with the Search Action.
</Note>

### Choose your Model

Each Agent has a default language model that powers the search understanding.
You can change the model for your session by clicking the **Model** dropdown in the input bar.

<Tip>
  Can't find the model you want? Ask your Admin to add it to your Onyx deployment!
