Onyx Agents extend the capabilities of LLMs through custom instructions and Actions. 

In the Side Panel, you will find the Agents available in your Onyx deployment.

## Default Onyx Agent

Onyx's default Agent is a general purpose assistant that can help you with a wide range of tasks.
It is equipped with three Actions: Search, Internet Search, and Art.
