## What are Connectors?

Onyx uses Connectors to build an understanding of your documents, team,
and higher level concepts so that answers are grounded and specific to your organization's knowledge.

Connectors:
- Keep all updates synced between external systems and Onyx.
- Pull in metadata and additional signals to ensure answer relevance.
- Respect all user permissions (Enterprise Edition only).

  All processing and storage of documents and metadata happen within Onyx.

  There are options to use LLMs or third party providers during the indexing flow but by default everything is
  processing entirely locally.

  Click this card to see more about security.

<Card title="Why are connectors/indexing important?" icon="circle-nodes" href="/overview/core_features/internal_search">
  In the same way LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of internet data,
  Onyx builds an understanding of all of the documents, concepts, and people within your organization.

  This allows Onyx to provide more accurate answer to questions that relate to internal knowledge compared to using the
  applications' provided search APIs at query time.
