## What Data can you Acccess through Connectors?

Your Onyx administrators configure what sources are connected to Onyx. Additionally,
your admins can selectively index data from a source such as indexing a single Jira project.

Some connectors may be set to private or assigned to a specific User Group.
If you are not the connector owner or a member of the User Group, you will not see any of this data.
