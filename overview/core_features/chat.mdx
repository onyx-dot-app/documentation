The Chat interface is a conversational experience with your AI agents.
You'll see this if you send a natural language message to Onyx!

<Tip>
  You can force Onyx to show the Chat interface by clicking the Auto / Search / Chat toggle in the top left corner.
</Tip>

## How to use the Chat Interface

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type your message in the input bar" icon="pen-to-square">
    You can try asking Onyx "What data do you have access to?"

    You can finely control how Onyx responds using the input bar options. Don't worry,
    we'll cover this in more detail [below](#configure-your-chat-session).

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/start_chat.png" alt="Onyx Chat Interface" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Onyx will begin processing your request" icon="gears">
    You'll see Onyx plan, reason, or invoke any Actions available to the AI Agent you're using.
    If you sent an easy question, Onyx may respond instantly!

  </Step>

  <Step title="The AI responds conversationally" icon="pen-to-square">
    The default Onyx AI Agent is equipped with Search.
    This means it can consult your organization's data sources to answer your question.

    If the Search Action is invoked, you'll see a list of results in the right panel. Additionally,
    the AI will cite the sources it used in its response.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue your conversation or ask something new!" icon="pen-to-square">
    Send a follow up question, instruct the Agent to do something with your docs, or ask something completely new.

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/overview/core_features/follow_up.png" alt="Onyx Chat Interface" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="After sending your message" icon="pen-to-square">
    Your conversation will be saved in the History list of the Side Panel.

    <Info>
      Your admin may set a retention policy for your History that will automatically delete old conversations.

### Selecting an Agent

In the Side Panel, you will find the Agents available in your Onyx deployment.
Agents are AI powered with custom instructions and Actions.

Onyx's default Agent is a general purpose assistant that can help you with a wide range of tasks.
It is equipped with three Actions: Search, Web Search, and Art.

<AgentsPersonasAssistantsNote />

Below your most recently-used Agents, you will find the **Explore Assistants** button.
Clicking this will display all of your organization's custom Agents published by your Admins and Curators.

### Choose your Model

Each Agent has a default language model. At any time,
you can change the model for your session by clicking the **Model** dropdown in the input bar.

<Tip>
  Can't find the model you want? Ask your Admin to add it to your Onyx deployment!
</Tip>

### Thoughtful vs. Fast Responses

Clicking the hourglass icon in the input bar will let you choose between a thoughtful response or a fast response.

**Thoughtful** mode causes the AI to evaluate your question, execute multiple Actions,
and reflect on the results before generating a comprehensive response.

**Fast** mode causes the AI to generate a response as quickly as possible. Agents cannot invoke Actions in Fast mode.

<Note>
  Prefer one over the other? Set you preferred mode in your User Settings!
</Note>

Here you can see what Actions and MCPs are available to your Agent.

You can force or prevent an Action from being invoked by clicking the item or the block icon.
