## Overview

The image generation feature allows users to create PNG images according to their prompts which can be rendered in the
chat and easily downloaded.

## Configuration

Currently, Onyx supports three models for image generation, all through OpenAI or Azure. In the future,
we will be adding support for other options such as Nano Banana or Stability AI.

**GPT-Image-1.5**: Newest model, best for production-quality generation,
with strong prompt control and reliable in-image text/structured layouts

**GPT-Image-1**: Newer model, better prompt adherence. Likely a better default for most use cases.

**DALL-E 3**: Older model, slightly better for more imaginative and rich styles.

## Usage

Configure your image generation models in the Admin Panel under **Configuration** → **Image Generation**.

Once configured, you can invoke the Image Generation action from any Agent or AI model in Onyx.

<Tip>
  Be explicit in prompting for specific Actions you want your Agent to invoke.
