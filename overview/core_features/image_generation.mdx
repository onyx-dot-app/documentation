## Overview

The image generation feature allows users to create PNG images according to their prompts which can be rendered in the
chat and easily downloaded.

## Configuration

Currently, Onyx supports five models for image generation, through OpenAI, Azure or Vertex (Google). In the future,
we will be adding support for other options such as Stability AI.

**GPT-Image-1.5**: Newest model, best for production-quality generation,
with strong prompt control and reliable in-image text/structured layouts

**GPT-Image-1**: Newer model, better prompt adherence. Likely a better default for most use cases.

**Nano Banana**: Flash Gemini model designed for fast and efficient image generation. Great for fast, creative exploration and simple tasks.

**Nano Banana Pro**: Advanced Gemini model with professional and high-fidelity 4K output. Great for complex tasks where consistency and details are key.

**DALL-E 3**: Older model, slightly better for more imaginative and rich styles.

## Usage

Configure your image generation models in the Admin Panel under **Configuration** → **Image Generation**.

Once configured, you can invoke the Image Generation action from any Agent or AI model in Onyx.

<Tip>
  Be explicit in prompting for specific Actions you want your Agent to invoke.
