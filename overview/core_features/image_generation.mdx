## Overview
The image generation feature allows users to create PNG images according to their prompts which can be rendered in the chat and easily downloaded.

## Configuration
Currently, Onyx supports two APIs for image generation, both through OpenAI. In the future, there likely will be support for other options such as Google Imagen or Stability AI.
1. **GPT-Image-1**: Newer model, better prompt adherence. Likely a better default for most use cases.
2. **DALL-E 3**: Older model, slightly better for more imaginative and rich styles.

## Usage
To use **Image Generation**, be explicit in the prompting since the system is tuned to not generate images unless directly instructed.

See below for the instructions provided to the system for when to create images.
<Accordion title="Image Generation Instruction">
    Tool Description:
    ```
    Generate an image from a prompt.
    ```

    Instruction (System Prompt) Modification:
    ```
    NEVER use image_gen unless the user specifically requests an image.
    ```
    This phrase is injected into the default **Instruction** for Onyx if the **Image Generation** (image_gen) tool is available.
