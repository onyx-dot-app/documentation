**Actions** are a way to give an Assistant additional capabilities. They allow the assistant to do things like:

- Fetch information from an external source (e.g. a database, an API, or the Web)
- Perform actions (e.g. write to a database or send an email)
- Generate content (e.g. generate an image or create a plot)

## Built-in Actions

By default, we have three actions built-in to Onyx. These are:

- **Knowledge** - This action is the core of Onyx. Adding this action to an Assistant allows it to search over the knowledge you've connected up to Onyx through `Connectors`. This is the only action available to the default `Onyx` assistant.

- **Image Generation** - This action allows your assistant to generate images using DALL-E 3.

- **Web Search** - This action allows your assistant to search the web.

## Custom Actions

Beyond the built-in actions, Onyx allows you to create custom actions tailored to your specific needs and workflows.
