## Overview

**Actions** give Agents the ability to interact with external systems.

Onyx comes with 4 built-in Actions and allows users to configure additional ones via
[OpenAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification)
and [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP).

The built-in Actions include:

## Custom Actions

Onyx offers flexible options for configuring both custom Actions and their associated authentication.

Admins can choose to:
- Use a single shared authentication, giving all users the same level of access to Actions.
- Require each user to complete their own authentication flow, so Actions respect individual user permissions.

Onyx supports both token-based authentication and OAuth.

## Actions Button

In the Chat input bar, Actions are grouped by the MCP server or OpenAPI schema they are registered with.
Users have the flexibility to turn on/off the Actions that the Agent/LLM has access to on the fly.
