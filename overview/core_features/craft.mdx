Onyx Craft lets users create web applications, documents, presentations,
and more from company knowledge using an AI coding agent in an isolated sandbox. Users describe what they want,
and the agent builds artifacts using their indexed documents and uploaded files.

<Note>
  Craft requires an LLM provider to be configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) to function.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Session** - Start a new Craft session from the `/build` route in Onyx
2. **Describe What You Need** - Tell the agent what you want to build in natural language
3. **Watch It Build** - The agent creates your artifact using your company knowledge
4. **Preview & Iterate** - See your output live and request changes or additions
5. **Download** - Export your finished artifact

## What You Can Build

Craft excels at creating artifacts that leverage your company's knowledge:

- **Interactive Dashboards** - Visualize metrics and KPIs from your connected data sources
- **Internal Tools** - Build custom web applications for specific workflows
- **Documents & Reports** - Generate polished documents from your indexed content
- **Presentations** - Create slide decks with AI-generated visuals
- **Data Explorers** - Interactive interfaces for browsing and analyzing documents
- **Prototypes** - Quickly prototype ideas using your existing data

## Technical Details

<Accordion title="Sandbox Environment">
  Each Craft session runs in an isolated sandbox with:
  - **Next.js** application framework with React
  - **shadcn/ui** component library for polished UI elements
  - **Recharts** for data visualization
  - **Python environment** with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib for data processing
  - Read-only access to your indexed documents
  - Separate workspace for each session
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="File Upload Limits">
  - Maximum file size: **50MB** per file
  - Maximum files per session: **20 files**
  - Maximum total size per session: **200MB**
  - Supported formats: CSV, JSON, PDF, images, and common code files
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deployment Options">
  Craft can run in two modes:
  - **Local mode** - Sandboxes run as directories within the Docker Compose deployment (default)
  - **Kubernetes mode** - Sandboxes run as isolated Kubernetes pods with automatic snapshots and cleanup
  (production-scale deployments)
</Accordion>

## Enabling Craft

### New Deployments

When installing Onyx, use the `--include-craft` flag:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/main/deployment/docker_compose/install.sh > install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh --include-craft
```

The `--include-craft` flag:
- Sets `ENABLE_CRAFT=true` in the `.env` file
- Sets `IMAGE_TAG=craft-latest` to use the Craft-enabled images
- Runs the Craft template setup script on container startup

<Note>
  Craft adds Node.js 20 and the opencode CLI to the backend image, which increases build time and image size.
  The first startup may take longer while templates are set up.
</Note>

### Existing Deployments

If you've already deployed Onyx without Craft, you can enable it manually:

1. Navigate to the installation directory (default: `onyx_data/deployment`)
2. Edit the `.env` file and set:

   ```bash
   ENABLE_CRAFT=true
   IMAGE_TAG=craft-latest
   ```

3. Rebuild and restart:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

### Verify Craft is Enabled

After installation:
- The backend container logs should show "Setting up Onyx Craft templates..."
- The `/build` route should be accessible in the UI

<Warning>
  Ensure you have an LLM provider configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) for Craft to work.
</Warning>
