## What's Coming

The Onyx Workflows feature will enable:

- **Asynchronous Actions**: Set up Agents to run when triggered by events or on a time basis.
- **Batch Processing**: Set up instructions to run against large sets of objects to automate repeat work.
- **Acknowledgements**: Optionally set up notifications to give approval for more sensitive Actions.
- **Reports**: Get breakdowns of the work that was done for you in the background.
