## How it works
The Xenforo Connector scrapes forums or threads from the specified URL.
It currently does not support incremental updates ... this is planned for a future release.

## Setting up
### Authorization
    - As long as the page is reachable, no additional authorization is necessary.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Xenforo** Connector.
    2. Input the base URL to index (either a forum or thread URL) and click "Create Connector".
