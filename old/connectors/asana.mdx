## How it works

The Asana connector pulls in tasks and their associated comments from specified projects or all projects in a workspace.

## Setting up

### Authorization

1. Create an Asana Personal Access Token:
   - Log in to your Asana account and go to https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps
   - Click "Create New Personal Access Token"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Onyx Integration") and create the token
   - Copy the token - you'll need to provide this to Onyx

### Indexing

1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Asana** Connector
2. Provide the following information:

   - **Asana API Token**: Paste the Personal Access Token you created earlier

   - **Workspace ID**: Enter your Asana workspace ID. You can find this at https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces. It's a number that looks like 1234567890123456.

   - **Project IDs** (optional): If you want to index specific projects, enter their IDs separated by commas. Leave this empty to index all projects in the workspace. Example: 1234567890123456,2345678901234567. You can find a project ID by clicking on a project in Asana. In the URL, it will look like https://app.asana.com/0/1208338159336610/1208338159510597, where "1208338159336610" is the project ID.

   - **Team ID** (optional): If you want to index team-visible tasks in addition to public tasks, enter a team ID. Leave this empty if you don't need this feature.

3. Click "Connect" to start the indexing process

Note: The connector will respect the permissions of the user associated with the provided API token. Ensure that this user has access to all the projects you want to index.
