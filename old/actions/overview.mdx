**Actions** are a way to give an Assistant additional capabilities. They allow the assistant to do things like:

1. Fetch information from an external source (e.g. a database, an API, or the Internet)
2. Perform actions (e.g. write to a database or send an email)
3. Generate content (e.g. generate an image or create a plot)

By default, we have three actions built-in to Onyx. These are:

- `Knowledge` - This action is the core of Onyx. Adding this action to an Assistant allows
  it to search over the knowledge you've connected up to Onyx through `Connectors`.
  This is the only action available to the default `Onyx` assistant.

- `Image Generation` - This action allows your assistant to generate images using DALL-E 3.

- `Internet Search` - This action allows your assistant to search the web (see setup here: [Internet Search](../../more/internet_search)).
