## Onyx Overview

Onyx is the AI Assistant connected to your organization’s docs, apps, and people. Onyx makes Generative AI more versatile for work by enabling
new types of questions like “What is the most common feature request we’ve heard from customers this month”. Whereas other AI systems have no
context of your team and are generally unhelpful with work related questions, Onyx makes it possible to ask these questions in natural language
and get back answers in seconds.

Onyx can connect to +30 different tools and the use cases are not limited to the ones in the following pages. The highlighted use cases are
for inspiration and come from feedback gathered from our users and customers.

## Common Getting Started Questions:

#### Why are these docs connected in my Onyx deployment?

> **Answer:** This is just an example of how connectors work in Onyx. You can connect up your own team’s knowledge and you will be able to ask
> questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.

#### Is my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?

> **Answer:** No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on
> with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate
> answers.

#### Where is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?

> **Answer:** This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition. If you are on Onyx Cloud,
> you have access to them by default. If you’re running it yourself, reach out to the Onyx team to receive access.
