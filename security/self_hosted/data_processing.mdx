## Local Data Processing

### Complete Data Isolation
All data processing occurs within your infrastructure, ensuring complete control over your data. No data leaves your network except for the specific communications you configure.

### Local Model Execution
- **Embedding Models**: All document embedding generation happens locally
- **LLM Integration**: Bring your own LLM - no data sent to external services unless explicitly configured
- **Vector Operations**: All similarity searches and vector operations performed locally
- **Data Processing**: Document parsing, chunking, and metadata extraction done on-premises

## Data Flow Security

### Inbound Data
- **Connector Authentication**: Secure authentication with your source systems
- **Encrypted Transfer**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all data transfers
- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs within your deployment
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage in your controlled environment

### Outbound Communications
- **Actions Only**: Data leaves your network only through configured actions
- **LLM API Calls**: Optional external LLM calls with your chosen provider
- **Audit Logging**: Complete logging of all outbound communications
- **Configurable Controls**: Granular control over what data can leave your network

## Security Benefits

### Complete Control
- **Data Sovereignty**: Your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Network Isolation**: Complete control over network access and security
- **Compliance**: Meet strict compliance requirements with full data control
- **Audit Capability**: Complete visibility into all data processing

### Bring Your Own Everything
- **LLM Provider**: Choose your preferred LLM provider or run models locally
- **Infrastructure**: Deploy on your preferred cloud or on-premises infrastructure
- **Security Tools**: Integrate with your existing security and monitoring tools
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Implement your specific compliance requirements
