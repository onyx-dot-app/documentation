## Deployment Security

### In what cases should a team self-host?
Self-hosting Onyx offers maximum security by keeping all data within your own infrastructure, giving you full control over data processing, storage, and network access configurations.
For teams with the highest security requirements, self-hosting is often the preferred choice. However, it requires more operational overhead compared to the Cloud offering, so we generally recommend Cloud unless self-hosting is specifically needed.

Teams may also choose to self-host if they don't require Enterprise Edition capabilities. While this can reduce costs, it does mean foregoing certain advanced security features available in the Enterprise Edition.

### Can I run Onyx completely offline in an air-gapped fashion?
Yes, but you would need to also host your own LLM for Onyx to connect to. It is always recommended to use a large LLM over quantized or light versions of major models.

### How do I keep my Onyx deployment up to date or get security patches?
Every Onyx deployment is backwards compatible and very rarely require any manual intervention outside of running a redeployment command. Visit the [Deployment section](/deployment/overview) for more details.

### Is it possible to configure monitoring for Self-Hosted Onyx
Yes, Onyx supports Prometheus and can easily be hooked up to monitoring applications like Grafana. For monitoring LLM usage, Onyx uses LangGraph so it can also integrate with LangSmith
