# Common Questions

This page addresses frequently asked questions about self-hosted Onyx deployments and security.

## Deployment Security

### How secure is a self-hosted Onyx deployment?
Self-hosted deployments provide the highest level of security as all data remains within your infrastructure. You have complete control over data processing, storage, and network access.

### What infrastructure do I need for a secure deployment?
You'll need secure infrastructure with proper network segmentation, encryption capabilities, and access controls. Onyx can be deployed on any infrastructure that supports Docker containers.

### Can I run Onyx completely offline?
Yes, Onyx can be configured to run completely offline with local LLM models and no external dependencies, except for the initial data ingestion from your connectors.

## Data Control

### Does any data leave my network in a self-hosted deployment?
No, unless you explicitly configure external actions or LLM API calls. All data processing, storage, and retrieval happens within your infrastructure.

### Can I use my own LLM models?
Yes, you can bring your own LLM models and run them locally, or use your preferred LLM provider's API. You have complete control over which external services Onyx communicates with.

### How do I ensure my deployment meets compliance requirements?
With self-hosted deployments, you control all aspects of data handling, making it easier to meet strict compliance requirements. Onyx provides the tools to implement your specific compliance needs.

## Security Configuration

### What security measures should I implement for my deployment?
Implement network segmentation, encryption at rest and in transit, proper access controls, regular security updates, and comprehensive monitoring and logging.

### Can I integrate with my existing security tools?
Yes, Onyx can integrate with your existing security tools, SIEM systems, and monitoring platforms. All system events and logs are available for integration.

### How do I handle security updates?
Security updates are handled through your standard patch management process. Onyx provides regular security updates that you can apply according to your security policies.

## Compliance and Auditing

### What audit capabilities does self-hosted Onyx provide?
Onyx provides comprehensive audit logging for all data access, user actions, and system events. All logs are stored locally and can be integrated with your audit systems.

### Can I meet specific compliance requirements with self-hosted Onyx?
Yes, self-hosted deployments give you complete control over data handling, making it easier to meet specific compliance requirements like HIPAA, SOC 2, or industry-specific regulations.
