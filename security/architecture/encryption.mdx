# Encryption

This page details Onyx's encryption standards and implementation across all data and communications.

## Encryption Standards

### Data at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or cloud KMS
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation with configurable schedules
- **Backup Encryption**: Separate encryption keys for backup data

### Data in Transit
- **Protocol**: TLS 1.3
- **Cipher Suites**: Only strong cipher suites enabled
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate provisioning and renewal
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange for all connections

## Encryption Implementation

### Application Layer
- **API Communications**: All API calls encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Database Connections**: Encrypted connections to all databases
- **File Uploads**: Encrypted file transfer and storage
- **User Sessions**: Encrypted session tokens and cookies

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Load Balancers**: TLS termination with strong cipher suites
- **CDN**: Encrypted content delivery
- **Storage**: Encrypted object storage with customer-managed keys
- **Backups**: Encrypted backup storage with separate encryption keys

## Key Management

### Cloud Deployments
- **AWS KMS**: Integration with AWS Key Management Service
- **Azure Key Vault**: Integration with Azure Key Vault
- **GCP KMS**: Integration with Google Cloud KMS
- **Customer-Managed Keys**: Option for customer-controlled encryption keys

### Self-Hosted Deployments
- **Local Key Management**: Secure key storage on-premises
- **HSM Integration**: Hardware Security Module support
- **Key Backup**: Secure backup and recovery procedures
