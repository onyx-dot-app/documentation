## Data Ingestion Flow

1. **Connector Authentication**: Secure authentication with source systems
2. **Data Extraction**: Encrypted data retrieval from source systems
3. **Data Processing**: Secure processing and transformation of documents
4. **Vector Generation**: Local embedding generation for document chunks
5. **Storage**: Encrypted storage in vector database

## Query Processing Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication and session management
2. **Query Processing**: Secure query parsing and vectorization
3. **Retrieval**: Secure document retrieval from vector database
4. **LLM Communication**: Encrypted communication with language models
5. **Response Generation**: Secure response formatting and delivery

## Security Measures

- All data flows are encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
- Authentication tokens are securely managed and rotated
- Data processing occurs in isolated environments
- Comprehensive logging of all data access and modifications
