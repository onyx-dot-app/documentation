## Network Architecture

### Perimeter Security
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protection against common web attacks
- **DDoS Protection**: Multi-layer DDoS mitigation
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **IP Filtering**: Optional IP whitelisting and blacklisting

### Network Segmentation
- **Public Zones**: Internet-facing services with strict access controls
- **Application Zones**: Internal application services
- **Database Zones**: Isolated database access
- **Management Zones**: Administrative access with additional security

## Security Measures

### Traffic Protection
- **TLS 1.3**: Mandatory encryption for all external communications
- **Certificate Pinning**: Protection against certificate-based attacks
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy implementation

### Access Controls
- **VPN Access**: Secure VPN for administrative access
- **Bastion Hosts**: Jump servers for secure server access
- **Network ACLs**: Granular network access control lists
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules for service-to-service communication

## Monitoring and Detection

### Network Monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time threat detection and alerting
- **Traffic Analysis**: Anomaly detection for unusual network patterns
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging and analysis
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Comprehensive security monitoring

### Incident Response
- **Automated Response**: Immediate response to detected threats
- **Manual Investigation**: Security team investigation procedures
- **Communication**: Customer notification procedures
- **Recovery**: Incident recovery and lessons learned
