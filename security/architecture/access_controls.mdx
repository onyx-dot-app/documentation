## Single Sign On (SSO)

In the Community Edition of Onyx, basic auth using email + password and SSO using Google OAuth are supported.

In the Enterprise Edition of Onyx, SSO to all standard Identity Providers (like Okta, Azure Entra ID, etc.)
is supported via OIDC (recommended) and SAML.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC protection to documents and resources are only available in the Enterprise Edition of Onyx.
The following resources can be gated by users and groups.
- Agents
- Actions
- Document access
- Usage rate limits

## Document Access

Different access to documents is only available in the Enterprise Edition of Onyx.
The two ways of gating access to documents are:

- Automatically mirroring them from external sources (such as Google Drive, Salesforce, etc.).
- Directly assigning access to users or groups of users. Often less convenient but requires less
  calls to external APIs which may be preferred in certain deployments.

## User Roles

- **Admin**: Full system access, audit, and configuration capabilities
- **Curator**: Document management and content curation (only available on Enterprise Edition)
- **User**: Standard access to chat and search functionality
