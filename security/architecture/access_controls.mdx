## Single Sign On (SSO)

In both Community and Enterprise Editions of Onyx, you can configure basic authentication with email and password.

Additionally, you can configure SSO through popular identity providers such as Google, Okta, and Azure EntraID (OAuth, OIDC, and SAML are all supported).

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC protection to documents and resources are only available in the Enterprise Edition of Onyx.
The following resources can be gated by users and groups.
- Agents
- Actions
- Document access
- Usage rate limits

## Document Access

Different access to documents is only available in the Enterprise Edition of Onyx.
The two ways of gating access to documents are:

- Automatically mirroring them from external sources (such as Google Drive, Salesforce, etc.).
- Directly assigning access to users or groups of users. Often less convenient but requires less
  calls to external APIs which may be preferred in certain deployments.

## User Roles

- **Admin**: Full system access, audit, and configuration capabilities
- **Curator**: Document management and content curation (only available on Enterprise Edition)
- **User**: Standard access to chat and search functionality
