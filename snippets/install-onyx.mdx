<Step title="Install and Configure Onyx">
    To install Onyx, we'll need to clone the repo and set the necessary environment variables.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git

    cd onyx/deployment/docker_compose
    cp env.prod.template .env
    cp env.nginx.template .env.nginx
    ```

    Fill out the `.env` and `.env.nginx` files.

    ```bash .env expandable
    WEB_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>  # Something like "onyx.app"

    # If your email is something like "chris@onyx.app", then this should be "onyx.app"
    # This prevents people outside your company from creating an account
    VALID_EMAIL_DOMAINS=<YOUR_COMPANIES_EMAIL_DOMAIN>

    # See our auth guides for options here
    AUTH_TYPE=
    ```

    ```bash .env.nginx
    DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>  # Something like "onyx.app"
    ```
</Step>

<Step title="Launch Onyx">
    Running the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script will get us a SSL certificate from letsencrypt and launch the Onyx stack.

    ```bash
    ./init-letsencrypt.sh
    ```
    
    If you are skipping the HTTPS setup, start Onyx manually:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
    ```
    
    <Note>
        Give Onyx a few minutes to start up. 
        
        You can monitor the progress with `docker logs onyx-stack-api_server-1 -f`.
    </Note>

    You can access Onyx from the instance Public IPv4 or from the domain you set up earlier!
