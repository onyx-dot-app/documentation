<Step title="Point domain to the instance">
    <Note>
      If you don't have a domain, buy one from a DNS provider like [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
      or just skip HTTPS for now.
    </Note>

    To point our domain to the new instance, we need to add an `A` and `CNAME` record to our DNS provider.
