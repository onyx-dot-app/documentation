<Step title="Point domain to the instance">
    <Note>
      If you don't have a domain, buy one from a DNS provider like [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
      or just skip HTTPS for now.
    </Note>

    To point our domain to the new instance, we need to add an `A` and `CNAME` record to our DNS provider.

    The `A` record should be the subdomain that you would like to use for the Onyx instance like `prod`.

    The `CNAME` record should be the same name with the `www.` in front resulting in `www.prod` pointing to the full
    domain like `prod.onyx.app`.
