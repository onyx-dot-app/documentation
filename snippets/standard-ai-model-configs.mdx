<Step title="Configure Default and Fast Models">
    The **Default Model** is selected automatically for new custom Agents and Chat sessions.

    Designating a **Fast Model** is optional.
    This **Fast Model** is used behind the scenes for quick operations such as evaluating the type of message,
    generating different queries (query expansion), and naming the chat session.

    <Tip>
      If you select a Fast Model,
      make sure it is a relatively quick and cost-effective model like GPT-4.1-mini or Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
    </Tip>

<Step title="Choose Visible Models">
    In the **Advanced Options**, you will see a list of all models available from this provider.
    You may choose which models are visible to your users in Onyx.

    Setting visible models is useful when a provider publishes multiple models and versions of the same model.
</Step>

<Step title="Designate Provider Access">
    Lastly, you may select whether or not the provider is public to all users in Onyx.

    If set to private,
    the provider's models will be available to Admins and User Groups you explicitly assign the provider to.
