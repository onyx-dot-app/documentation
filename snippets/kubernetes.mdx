The Onyx Helm chart packages all the required services (API, web, PostgreSQL, Vespa, etc.) into a single deployment. By default, persistent volumes will be created for stateful services (e.g. PostgreSQL, Vespa).

<Steps> 
  <Step title="Add the Onyx Helm repository"> 
    ```bash 
    helm repo add onyx https://onyx-dot-app.github.io/onyx/ 
    helm repo update
    helm search repo onyx
    ```
  </Step> 

  <Step title="Install Onyx"> 
    Install into its own namespace (recommended): 
  
    ```bash 
    kubectl create namespace onyx 
    helm install onyx onyx/onyx-stack -n onyx 
    ``` 
    
    This will pull the latest Onyx chart and deploy all dependencies. 
  </Step> 

  <Step title="Verify the installation"> 

    ```bash 
    helm list -n onyx 
    kubectl get pods -n onyx 
    ``` 

    Wait until all pods are in a `Running` state before accessing Onyx. 
  </Step> 

  <Step title="Access Onyx"> 
    By default, the chart exposes Onyx via a Kubernetes Service. For local testing, you can port-forward: 
  
    ```bash 
    kubectl -n onyx port-forward service/onyx-nginx 8080:80 
    ``` 

    Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). 

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Onyx"> 
    Configure your deployment by modifying the `values.yaml` file in the `onyx/deployment/helm/charts/onyx` directory.

    You'll need to restart Onyx after changing any `values.yaml` variables.

    ```bash
    helm upgrade onyx onyx/onyx-stack -n onyx -f deployment/helm/charts/onyx/values.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
