## "Access Restricted" — Locked Out of the Application

If users see an **Access Restricted** page, the workspace is locked.
This happens when a subscription expires or when the seat limit is exceeded.

Only **admins** can resolve this. Non-admin users will see a message asking them to contact their administrator.

Even when locked out, admins can still access:

- **Admin Panel > Plans & Billing** — to renew or resubscribe
- **Admin Panel > Users** — to manage users and free up seats

### Subscription expired

**Cloud**: Go to **Plans & Billing** and resubscribe through Stripe.

**Self-hosted**:
Go to **Plans & Billing** and either renew your subscription or [upload an updated license
file](/admins/billing/manage#air-gapped-license-activation).

Access is restored immediately after renewal. No data is lost.

### Seat limit exceeded

Your workspace has more active users than your plan allows. **All users** are blocked — not just the most recent ones.

To fix this, either increase your seat count from **Plans & Billing**,
or remove users from **Admin Panel > Users** until usage is within the limit. Access is restored immediately.

## Enterprise Features Unavailable

If you see an error when trying to access features like analytics, user groups, or query history,
your workspace does not have an active paid plan.

These features require a Business or Enterprise subscription:

- User Groups and access controls
- Analytics and usage dashboards
- Query History
- Usage Reports
- Standard Answers
- Token Rate Limits

Navigate to **Admin Panel > Plans & Billing** to [subscribe](/admins/billing/subscribing).

## Cannot Invite or Add Users

If inviting users, new sign-ups, or reactivating users fails, your seat limit has likely been reached.

Either increase your seat count from the [billing page](/admins/billing/manage),
or remove users from **Admin Panel > Users** to free up seats.

## Unable to Connect to Stripe (Self-Hosted)

If your self-hosted instance cannot reach Stripe, you'll see a banner on the billing page:

> "Unable to connect to Stripe payment portal."

Click **Connect to Stripe** to retry. If your instance is permanently offline or behind a firewall,
you can [upload a license file manually](/admins/billing/manage#air-gapped-license-activation) instead.

## License File Fails to Validate (Self-Hosted)

If uploading a license file returns an error:

- Make sure you are using the **complete** file contents, including the `-----BEGIN ONYX LICENSE-----`
  and `-----END ONYX LICENSE-----` delimiters
- Check for extra whitespace or line breaks that may have been introduced when copying
- Ensure the file was issued for your specific Onyx instance

Contact **support@onyx.app** if the issue persists.
