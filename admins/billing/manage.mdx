Once you have an active subscription, you can manage it from **Admin Panel > Plans & Billing**.

The billing page shows your plan, next payment date, and current seat usage.

## Managing Seats

Every active user in your workspace counts as a seat, including Slack bot accounts.
You can adjust your seat count at any time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open seat management">
    Click **Update Seats** on the billing page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the new count">
    Enter your desired number of seats.
    You cannot go below the number of seats currently in use (active users + pending invitations).

    <Note>
      Need to reduce seats below current usage? [Remove users](/admins/user_management/users_and_groups) first,
      then adjust the seat count.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the billing impact">
    - **Adding seats** — you'll be billed a pro-rated amount immediately.
    - **Removing seats** — the change takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    Click **Confirm Change** to apply.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Stripe Customer Portal

Click **Manage Plan** on the billing page to open the Stripe customer portal. From there you can:

- Update your payment method
- View and download invoices
- Cancel or modify your subscription

## Air-Gapped License Activation

For self-hosted deployments without internet access,
you can activate a license manually instead of going through Stripe checkout.

Contact the Onyx team at **support@onyx.app** to request a license file.
You will receive a file containing your signed license in this format:

```
-----BEGIN ONYX LICENSE-----
eyJwYXlsb2FkIjogeyJ2ZXJzaW9...
-----END ONYX LICENSE-----
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Plans & Billing">
    Navigate to **Admin Panel > Plans & Billing** from the sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the license form">
    Click **Activate License Key** at the bottom of the billing page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload your license">
    Paste the contents of your license file, or use the file upload button to attach it directly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate">
    Click **Activate License**. Your license will be validated and paid features will be enabled immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

To update an existing license (e.g., after renewal or a seat change),
click **Update License Key** instead and follow the same steps.
