Onyx offers multiple plans to fit your team's needs.
How you subscribe and manage billing depends on whether you're using **Onyx Cloud** or a **Self-Hosted** deployment.

## Plans

Onyx's core features — connectors, AI chat, agents, search, and more — are free and open-source.
Paid plans unlock additional capabilities for teams and organizations.
