## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Plans & Billing">
    Navigate to **Admin Panel > Plans & Billing** from the sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a plan">
    Click **Get Business Plan** to continue, or **Contact Sales** for Enterprise pricing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your billing cycle">
    Select **Monthly** or **Annual** billing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your seat count">
    Enter the number of seats you need. The minimum is based on your current active users and Slack bot accounts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete payment">
    Click **Continue to Payment** to open Stripe checkout. After payment, you'll be redirected back to Onyx.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  New Business subscriptions include a **1-month free trial**. You won't be charged until the trial ends.
</Tip>

Once subscribed, paid features like RBAC, analytics, and query history are enabled right away.

## Self-Hosted License Activation

On **Onyx Cloud**, your subscription is active immediately after checkout — there's nothing else to do.

On **self-hosted** deployments, a **license** is automatically claimed and stored on your instance after checkout.
The license is cryptographically signed and validated locally,
so your instance does not need to phone home on every request.

<Note>
  If your self-hosted deployment cannot reach the internet,
  you can [upload a license file manually](/admins/billing/manage#air-gapped-license-activation)
  instead of going through Stripe checkout.
</Note>
