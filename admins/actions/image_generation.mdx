The image generation action allows your Agents to create images based on text prompts. Once configured,
any AI model in Onyx can invoke this action to generate images using supported image generation models.

## Supported Models

| Model | Provider |
| ----- | -------- |
| GPT Image 1.5 | OpenAI / Azure OpenAI |
| GPT Image 1 | OpenAI / Azure OpenAI |
| DALL-E 3 | OpenAI / Azure OpenAI |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect a Model">
    The page displays available models grouped by provider (OpenAI and Azure OpenAI).

    Click **Connect** on any model to configure it. A modal will open where you can set up credentials:

    - **Use existing API key**: Select from previously configured OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API keys
    - **Enter new API key**: Add a new API key for the provider

    The last configured model will automatically become the **Current Default**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage Default Model">
    The model marked as **Current Default** is used when users request image generation in chat.

    - To **remove** a model as default: Click the "Current Default" badge on that model
    - To **edit credentials**: Click the settings icon (gear) to open a modal where you can update the API key
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Image Generation

Once image generation is configured with a default model,
any AI model in Onyx can invoke the image generation action. When a user requests an image,
the Agent will automatically use the configured default image generation model.
