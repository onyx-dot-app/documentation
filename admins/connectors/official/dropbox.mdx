## How it works

The Dropbox connector ingests all documents from your Dropbox account into Onyx.

The connector recursively pulls all files from the root directory of your Dropbox account.
It is currently not possible to pull files only from specific directories.

The connector will only pull once upon initialization. If you would like to pull more documents,
you must generate a new access token (step 6 below), put that token into the connector, and re-initialize the connector.

## Setting up

### Authorization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Dropbox app">
    Head over to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps and click the `Create app` button on the top right.
    Select `Scoped access` and `Full Dropbox` as the type of access.
    Give your app a name like 'Onyx Connector' and click `Create app`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant required scopes">
    Check the `files.content.read` and `sharing.write` permissions so the files can be read and links for the documents
    can be created. Click `Submit` to save the changes.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate access token">
    Navigate to the `Settings` tab and scroll down to the `OAuth 2` section.
    Click `Generate` to generate an access token.

    <Warning>
      You must complete granting permissions before generating an access token.
      Changing permissions will not affect existing access tokens, and Onyx will be unable to index your Dropbox.
