## How it works

The HubSpot connector pulls in data from your HubSpot CRM, including:
- **Tickets** - Support tickets with their title, content, associated emails and notes
- **Companies** - Company records with associated data and relationships
- **Deals** - Sales opportunities with pipeline information and associated contacts
- **Contacts** - Contact records with their information and associated activities

You can configure which object types to index based on your needs.
All selected data types are updated every **10** minutes.
