## How it works

The Airtable connector indexes records from your Airtable bases. Each record becomes a searchable document in Onyx,
with field names and values preserved.

You can choose to index **all bases and tables** accessible by your API token,
or a **specific table** by pasting its URL.

Table updates are pulled every 24 hours by default.

## Setting up

### 1. Create a Personal Access Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Builder Hub">
    In Airtable, click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner and select **Builder Hub**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Personal Access Tokens">
    In the Builder Hub sidebar, click **Personal access tokens**, then click **Create new token**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure scopes">
    Give your token a name (e.g. "Onyx") and add the following scopes:

    - `data.records:read` — read record data
    - `data.recordComments:read` — read record comments
    - `schema.bases:read` — read base and table schemas
    - `user.email:read` — read user email addresses (for collaborator fields)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant access to your bases">
    Under **Access**, grant the token access to all the bases you want indexed in Onyx.

    If you plan to use the **Everything** option, make sure the token has access to every base you want included.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and copy the token">
    Click **Create token** and copy it. You won't be able to see it again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Add the connector in Onyx

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Airtable connector">
    Navigate to the Admin Panel and select the **Airtable** connector.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a credential">
    Create a new credential and paste your Personal Access Token.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose what to index">
    You have two options:

    **Everything** — Automatically discovers and indexes all bases and tables that your token has access to.
    No additional configuration needed.

    **Specific Table** — Indexes a single table. To use this option:
    - Open the table you want in Airtable in your browser.
    - Copy the URL from the address bar (it looks like `https://airtable.com/appXXX/tblYYY/viwZZZ`).
    - Paste it into the **Airtable URL** field.

    The base ID, table ID, and view ID are automatically extracted from the URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced options

- **Treat all fields except attachments as metadata** — When enabled, text fields (like "Title" or "Description")
  are stored as metadata key-value pairs instead of searchable document content.
  Only attachment file contents become the searchable body of the document.
  Use this when the primary content you care about is in file attachments,
  and the other columns are just labels or categories.

- **Share ID** (Specific Table only) — If you want record links in Onyx to use a shared view URL, enter the share ID here (e.g. `shrkfjEzDmLaDtK83`). You can find this by creating a shared view in Airtable.
