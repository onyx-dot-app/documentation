This section walks through setting up the Google Drive connector using a Service Account.
More info on Service Accounts can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview).
A Google Workspace is required.

If you'd rather use an individuals account + OAuth to access Google Drive, checkout the section [here](./oauth).

### Indexing

First, navigate to the Admin Panel and select the Google Drive connector.

Then, create a new credential, then upload the key you downloaded in step 6. For the **Primary Admin Email**,
use the email of a user that:
- Has access to `Drive and Docs` in Google Workspace
- Has the following admin permissions:
    - Admin console privileges -> Services -> Drive and Docs -> Settings
    - Admin API privileges -> Users -> Read
    - Admin API privileges -> Groups -> Read
    - Admin API privileges -> Organization Units -> Read

This can either be an existing admin, or a brand new account created specifically for Onyx (e.g.
`onyx-robot@your-domain.com`). Note that this should *NOT* be the service account email.
This can be configured by an admin in the admin panel of the Google Workspace under Account > Admin roles.

Click **Create Credential**, and then close the dialog. From there,
click the **Continue** button and configure the connector!
