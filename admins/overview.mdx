## Admin Panel

The Onyx Admin Panel is accessed by clicking your user profile icon and selecting **Admin Panel**.

This centralized dashboard gives administrators comprehensive control over their Onyx workspace.

<Note>
  The first user in your Onyx instance will automatically be an Admin. Only Admins can designate other users as Admins.
