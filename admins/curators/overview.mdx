Curators are a special user type available in Onyx Enterprise Edition. Curators can manage Users and User Groups,
create and manage Connectors, and publish Agents to the User Group(s) they are assigned to.

## Assigning Curators

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a User Group">
    Navigate to the Admin Panel and select the **Groups** tab in the sidebar.

    Select **Create New Group**, assign your users, and add any Connectors that you want to share with the group.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Curator Role">
    Once your Group is created and synced, click into the Group.

    In the Role drop-down, select **Curator** for the users you want to promote.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Global Curators

Instead of manually assigning Curators within each Group, you can assign Global Curators from the Users management page.

Global Curators are automatically set as Curators for every Group they belong to.

## When to use Curators

Use Curators when you need to delegate administrative tasks to specific teams or departments while maintaining access
control boundaries.

### Common Scenarios

- Multi-team organizations requiring isolated data access (Sales, Marketing, Engineering)
- Departmental autonomy for connector and agent management
- Reducing admin workload while preventing workspace-wide permission escalation

### Benefits

- Group-scoped administrative privileges instead of global admin access
- Self-service connector and agent management for designated teams
- Maintains data isolation between different organizational units
