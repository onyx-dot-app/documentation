## Onyx Chrome Extension

Use the Onyx extension to ask questions from anywhere. You can also replace your new-tab page with a custom Onyx page which will
have Onyx Search as well as your favorite website bookmarks. You can also access Onyx as a sidebar to any page in Chrome.

In the future, the Onyx Chrome Extension will allow you to ask questions about the page you are currently on and optionally
index the recent pages into the Onyx knowledge base. You will be able to ask questions about recently visited pages via both
the extension and the Onyx web app.
