Onyx provides comprehensive analytics to help you understand how your users are interacting with the system and monitor usage patterns across your organization.

## Query History

On the Query History page, you can see a log of all messages sent to Onyx.
This includes messages sent to the Slack bot and through API keys.

### Exporting Query History

You can export your query history to a CSV file. 
This export can be time consuming depending on the size of your query history.

## Usage Statistics

On the Usage Statistics page, you can see a summary graph of the active users and number of queries sent to Onyx.

Additionally, you view the thumbs up and thumbs down feedback your users are giving their AI answers.
