Onyx Agents are customized AI assistants with unique instructions, knowledge sources, and Actions.

## Managing Agents

On the Agents page in the Admin Panel, you can see all of the Agents in your organization.

From this page, you can create new Agents, edit existing configs, designate featured Agents,
hide or show certain Agents, and delete them.
