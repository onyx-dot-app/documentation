## Adding Connectors

To create a new Connector as a Curator, navigate to the **Connectors** section in your Curator Panel and click **Add Connector**.

<Info>
  Curators can create Connectors for their assigned User Groups. These Connectors will be available to group members and can be used in Agents.
</Info>

For detailed information about all available Connectors, configuration options, and troubleshooting, see the [Connectors Overview](/admin/connectors/overview).

### Connector Configuration

Each Connector requires:
- **Name**: A descriptive name for your data source
- **Credentials**: Authentication details for accessing your source
- **Configuration**: Specific settings for data indexing
- **Access Controls**: Permissions for who can use this Connector

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/connectors/generic_config.png" alt="Onyx Connector Configuration page" />

### Managing Existing Connectors

View and manage your existing Connectors from the **Existing Connectors** page. Here you can:
- Monitor indexing status and progress
- Update configuration settings
- Manage access permissions
- View usage analytics

## Document Sets

Document Sets allow you to group related Connectors together, making it easier to organize content and assign specific knowledge sources to your Agents.

### Creating Document Sets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Document Sets">
    In your Curator Panel, go to the **Document Sets** section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Document Set">
    Click **Create Document Set** and provide a name and description for your document collection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Connectors">
    Select which Connectors should be included in this Document Set. You can combine multiple data sources into a single knowledge base.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Document Set Benefits

Document Sets provide several advantages:
- **Organized Knowledge**: Group related content from different sources
- **Simplified Agent Creation**: Assign entire document collections to Agents
- **Access Control**: Manage permissions at the document set level
- **Search Filtering**: Enable users to search within specific document collections

## Creating Custom Agents

Agents are the primary way Curators deliver specialized AI assistance to their teams. These AI assistants can be configured with specific knowledge sources, instructions, and capabilities.

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/agents/agents_overview.png" alt="Onyx Agents Overview page showing available agents" />

For comprehensive information about Agent configuration options, management features, and advanced settings, see the [Agents Overview](/admin/agents/overview).

### Agent Creation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Agent Creation">
    Navigate to the **Agents** section in your Curator Panel and click **Create New Agent**.

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/curators/create_agent.png" alt="Create New Agent Interface" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Basic Agent Configuration">
    Configure your Agent's fundamental properties:
    - **Name**: A clear, descriptive name for your Agent
    - **Description**: Brief explanation of the Agent's purpose
    - **Instructions**: Detailed prompt defining how the Agent should behave
    - **Icon**: Optional visual identifier for your Agent

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/agents/agent_instructions.png" alt="Onyx Agent Configuration page" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Knowledge Sources">
    Assign knowledge sources to your Agent by selecting:
    - **Document Sets**: Pre-organized collections of related documents
    - **Individual Connectors**: Specific data sources
    - **User Knowledge**: Personal documents (for private Agents)

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/curators/agent_knowledge_config.png" alt="Agent Knowledge Configuration" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Actions and Capabilities">
    Configure which Actions your Agent can perform:
    - **Web Search**: Enable internet search capabilities
    - **File Upload**: Allow users to upload documents
    - **Custom Actions**: MCP or OpenAPI-based custom tools

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/agents/agent_actions.png" alt="Onyx Agent Configuration page" />
    
    For more information about available Actions and creating custom Actions, see the [Actions Overview](/admin/actions/overview).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access and Sharing">
    Define who can access your Agent:
    - **Private**: Only you and selected users
    - **Group Access**: Available to specific User Groups
    - **Organization-wide**: Public to all users (requires approval)

    Configure starter messages and labels to help users understand your Agent's capabilities.

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/agents/agent_configs_misc.png" alt="Onyx Agent Configuration page" />
    
    For more information about User Groups and access management, see [User Management](/admin/user_management/groups).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Advanced Options">
    Fine-tune your Agent's behavior:
    - **Knowledge Options**: Search depth and result limits
    - **Model Selection**: Choose the AI model for your Agent
    - **Temperature Settings**: Control response creativity
    - **Date/Time Awareness**: Enable temporal context

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/agents/agent_knowledge_options.png" alt="Onyx Agent Configuration page" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Agent Management

Once created, manage your Agents through the Curator Panel:

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/curators/agent_management.png" alt="Agent Management Dashboard" />

#### Agent Status

Monitor your Agent's performance:
- **Active**: Agent is available and functioning
- **Featured**: Highlighted for organization-wide visibility
- **Draft**: Agent is being configured but not yet published
- **Archived**: Agent is disabled but preserved

#### Usage Analytics

Track how your Agents are being used:
- Conversation count and frequency
- User engagement metrics
- Knowledge source utilization
- Feedback and ratings

<img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/curators/agent_analytics.png" alt="Agent Usage Analytics" />

## Publishing and Promotion

### Making Agents Discoverable

Help users find and use your Agents effectively:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Discovery">
    Your published Agents appear in the **Explore Agents** tab for authorized users.
    
    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/agents/explore_agents.png" alt="Onyx Explore Agents page" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Featured Placement">
    Request Featured status to promote your Agent organization-wide. Featured Agents appear at the top of the Agents explorer.

    <Warning>
      Featured Agents become visible to all users in your organization, regardless of Group membership.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="User Training">
    Provide clear starter messages and comprehensive descriptions to guide users in effectively interacting with your Agents.
  </Step>
</Steps>
