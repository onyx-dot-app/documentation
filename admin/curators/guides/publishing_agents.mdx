As a Curator, you can create, publish, and manage Agents for your team (called a User Group in Onyx).
You can also choose to publish your Agents to your entire organization.

<Note>
You could be a Curator or a Global Curator. As a Global Curator, you are automatically a Curator for all Groups you are a member of. 
Otherwise, an Admin must add you as a Curator for each Group individually.
</Note>

Connectors and Document Sets you create will only be available to your Group(s). 
You may ask an Admin to make your resources public to your entire organization.

This guide will walk you through creating a custom knowledge Agent with your team's documents.

## Indexing Your Documents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Curator Panel">
    Navigate to the **Curator Panel** by clicking on your profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review existing Connectors">
    You should see the **Existing Connectors** page. Here, you'll find a list of Connectors that are public to your organization or associated with your Group.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create new Connector">
    To index new documents, click the **New Connector** button, select your source, and input any relevant credentials (see [Connectors](/admin/connectors/overview)).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Organize into Document Sets">
    Next, you should organize related Connectors into Document Sets. With Document Sets, documents on the same topic, but from different sources, are grouped together.

    You can also filter search results and narrow down the available docs to your Agent using Document Sets.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Your Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Agent creation">
    Once you have indexed your team's docs and organized them into Document Sets, you can start creating your Agent!

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/curators/overview_panel.png" alt="Agent Overview Panel" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure basic settings">
    Give your Agent a name, description, instructions, and maybe even an icon (see [Agents Overview](/admin/agents/overview)).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up knowledge access">
    This Agent will need Knowledge access and you'll narrow down the available docs to your team's Document Set.

    If you're making a private Agent, you can also add personal documents from My Documents to the Agent's knowledge base (called User Knowledge).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Group access">
    You don't want this Agent to be public to your entire organization, but you need to add it to your User Group.

    Add some starter messages to guide your teammates and label the Agent for organization purposes.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review knowledge options">
    Generally, you won't need to change the Knowledge Options, but you can experiment with different settings if the Agent is referencing old documents or you would like it to review more search results.

    Turning on Date Time Aware is useful if your Agent will field questions about the current date and time.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and publish">
    Click **Create** to publish your Agent!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Agent

Your Group should now see your Agent in the **Explore Agents** tab on the main Chat page.

You can move your Agent to the **Featured** area in the Curator Panel, but this will make it public to your entire organization.
