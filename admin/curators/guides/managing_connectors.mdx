As a Curator, you can create and manage Connectors for your team (called a User Group in Onyx).
Connectors you create will only be available to your Group(s), ensuring data access remains properly scoped.

<Note>
You could be a Curator or a Global Curator. As a Global Curator, you are automatically a Curator for all Groups you are a member of. 
Otherwise, an Admin must add you as a Curator for each Group individually.
</Note>

Connectors you create will only be available to your Group(s). 
You may ask an Admin to make your resources public to your entire organization.

This guide will walk you through creating and managing Connectors to index your team's documents and data sources.

## Creating a New Connector

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Curator Panel">
    Navigate to the **Curator Panel** by clicking on your profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review existing Connectors">
    You should see the **Existing Connectors** page. Here, you'll find a list of Connectors that are public to your organization or associated with your Group.

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/admin/curators/existing_connectors.png" alt="Existing Connectors" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create new Connector">
    Click the **New Connector** button to see all available connector types.

    Select the connector that matches your data source (e.g., Google Drive, Confluence, Slack).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure credentials">
    Most Connectors require authentication credentials to access your data source.

    Enter the required credentials such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or service account details.

    These credentials will be scoped to your Group and cannot be used by other Groups.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up connector configuration">
    Configure your Connector with:
    - **Name**: Give your Connector a descriptive name
    - **Source settings**: Specify which data to index (folders, channels, repositories, etc.)
    - **Access controls**: Choose between Private (Group-only) or Auto Sync Permissions if supported

    <Warning>
      As a Curator, you cannot create Public connectors. All connectors you create will be scoped to your Group(s).
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure advanced settings (optional)">
    Click **Advanced Configuration** to customize:
    - **Refresh Frequency**: How often to check for new data (default: 30 minutes)
    - **Prune Frequency**: How often to remove deleted data (default: 30 days)
    - **Indexing Start Date**: Only index data created after this date
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Connector">
    Click **Create** to start indexing your data source.

    The Connector will begin its initial indexing process and will be available to your Group once complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Existing Connectors

### Viewing Connector Status

In the **Existing Connectors** page, you can monitor:

- **Status**: Whether the Connector is actively indexing, paused, or encountering errors
- **Documents**: Number of documents indexed from the source
- **Last Sync**: When the Connector last retrieved new data

### Connector Permissions

As a Curator, you can:

- **Edit Connectors**: Only those belonging exclusively to your curated Group(s)
- **View Connectors**: Public connectors and connectors from other Groups
- **Use Public Connectors**: Attach them to your Agents, but cannot modify them

<Note>
If a Connector belongs to multiple Groups and you don't curate all of them, you can view it but cannot edit it.
</Note>

### Connector Actions

For Connectors you can edit, click on the Connector name to access:

#### Manage Options
- **Pause/Resume**: Stop or restart data syncing
- **Re-index**: Force a complete re-indexing of all data
- **Delete**: Remove the Connector and all its indexed data

#### Configuration Updates
- Modify source settings (folders, channels, etc.)
- Update credentials if they expire
- Adjust refresh and prune frequencies
- Change access controls

### Troubleshooting Connector Issues

#### Common Status Issues

| Status | Description | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Error** | Authentication or access issues | Check and update credentials |
| **Completed with errors** | Some documents failed to index | Click "Resolve all errors" to re-index |
| **Paused** | Connector stopped due to repeated errors | Resume after fixing the underlying issue |

#### Best Practices

- **Monitor regularly**: Check connector status weekly to catch issues early
- **Update credentials**: Refresh API keys and tokens before they expire  
- **Review permissions**: Ensure the connector has access to all intended data
- **Test with small datasets**: Start with limited data to verify configuration

## Using Connectors with Agents

Once your Connectors are successfully indexing data, you can attach them to Agents:

1. **Create or edit an Agent** in the Curator Panel
2. **Enable Knowledge access** in the Agent configuration
3. **Select your Connectors** from the available Group connectors
4. **Configure knowledge options** such as search settings and date awareness

Your Group's Agents will now have access to the data indexed by your Connectors, enabling them to answer questions and provide insights based on your team's documents.

## Connector Scope and Limitations

### What You Can Do
- Create Connectors scoped to your Group(s)
- Manage credentials for your Group's connectors
- Attach any available Connector (including Public ones) to your Agents
- Configure indexing settings and schedules

### What You Cannot Do
- Create Public connectors (Admin privilege required)
- Edit connectors belonging to other Groups
- Access credentials for Public or other Groups' connectors
- Delete connectors shared across multiple Groups you don't fully curate

<Info>
If you need a Public connector or want to share your connector with other Groups, contact your Admin to discuss making the connector organization-wide.
