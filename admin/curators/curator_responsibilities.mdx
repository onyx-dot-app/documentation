Curators are group-level administrators who manage objects that belong to their assigned group(s).
They can configure group-scoped content and settings without workspace-wide Admin privileges.

## Capabilities

Curators can perform the following actions for the group(s) they curate:

- **Add/remove Basic users** to/from a group
- **Create and manage credentials** for connectors (group-scoped)
- **Create and manage connectors** that belong exclusively to their group(s)
- **Create and manage personas (agents)** that belong exclusively to their group(s)
- **Attach connectors directly to agents** for group-specific knowledge access

## Restrictions

- **Edit scope**: Curators can only edit objects that belong exclusively to their curated group(s)
- **Cross-group items**: If an object belongs to a different group a Curator doesn't curate, they can view it
  but cannot edit it
- **Public objects**: Curators cannot create or edit public connectors or credentials
- **Group attachment required**: Curators must attach objects they create to a group they curate; otherwise they will
  not be able to see, edit, or delete the object

## Scope Rules and Examples

- **Group-only edit**: A Connector created for Group A can be edited by Curators of Group A
- **Public usage**: A Curator can attach a Public Connector to their group's agents, but cannot edit the Public Connector
- **Cross-Group visibility**: A Curator can view a Connector from Group B but cannot edit that Connector

## Global Curators

Global Curators have identical permissions to Curators, but automatically curate all groups they are members of.
