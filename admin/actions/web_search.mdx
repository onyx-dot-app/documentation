The web search action allows your Agents to query the internet and retrieve real-time information from web sources.

## Web Search in Onyx

### On Onyx Cloud

Web search is already active and ready to use on Onyx Cloud - no additional configuration required!

### Exa AI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Exa AI API key">
    Navigate to the [Exa AI dashboard](https://exa.ai/dashboard) and create a new API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the EXA_API_KEY environment variable">
    In your `.env` or `values.yaml` file, provide your Exa AI API key.

    ```bash .env
    EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
    ```

    ```bash values.yaml
    configMap:
      EXA_API_KEY: your_exa_api_key_here
    ```

    Once the EXA_API_KEY is set,
    the web search action will automatically appear in your Actions dashboard and can be attached to your Agents.

    <Note>
      Make sure your Agent has the Web Search Action enabled!
