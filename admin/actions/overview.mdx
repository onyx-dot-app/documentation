## What are Actions?

Actions in Onyx allow you to extend the functionality of your AI assistant by connecting it to external systems and APIs. Unlike connectors that pull
data into Onyx, actions enable Onyx to perform operations and trigger workflows in other systems.

## Key Benefits

### **Interactive Capabilities**

Actions enable your AI assistant to not just answer questions, but also perform tasks like creating tickets, sending emails, updating databases, or
triggering workflows.

### **System Integration**

Connect Onyx to your existing tools and workflows, allowing seamless interaction between your AI assistant and your business processes.

### **Automation**

Automate repetitive tasks by allowing users to request actions through natural language, which Onyx can then execute automatically.

### **Real-time Operations**

Perform real-time operations across multiple systems without requiring users to switch between different applications.

## Types of Actions

### **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Actions**

- Connect to MCP-compatible tools and services
- Enable rich interactions with development tools, databases, and more
- Support for complex workflows and multi-step operations

### **OpenAPI Actions**

- Connect to any service with an OpenAPI specification
- Standardized way to interact with REST APIs
- Easy integration with existing web services

## Common Use Cases

### **Customer Support**

- Create support tickets automatically
- Update customer records
- Send follow-up emails
- Escalate issues to the right team

### **Project Management**

- Create and update tasks
- Schedule meetings
- Update project status
- Generate reports

### **Development Operations**

- Deploy applications
- Run tests
- Update documentation
- Manage infrastructure

### **Business Operations**

- Process orders
- Update inventory
- Generate invoices
- Send notifications

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Action Type**: Decide between MCP or OpenAPI based on your needs
2. **Configure Authentication**: Set up the necessary credentials and permissions
3. **Define Actions**: Specify what operations your assistant can perform
4. **Test and Deploy**: Verify actions work correctly before making them available to users

## Security Considerations

- Actions can perform operations in external systems, so proper authentication and authorization are crucial
- Review and test all actions thoroughly before deployment
- Implement appropriate access controls and audit logging
- Consider the impact of actions on your existing systems and workflows
