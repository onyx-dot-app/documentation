Actions extend your agents beyond basic conversation by enabling them to perform specific tasks and interact with
external systems.

## Actions Dashboard

Actions can be viewed and configured in the **Actions** tab of the Admin Panel sidebar.

## Using Actions

To use an Action, you must configure an Agent to have access to it.
Onyx's built-in Actions are available in the general Chat experience.

Once your Agent has access to the action, it will automatically determine when and which Actions to invoke.
