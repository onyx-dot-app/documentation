## Overview

API keys allow secure programmatic access to Onyx services. Treat keys like passwords.

## Common Tasks

- Create a key: Click New API Key, add a label, and copy the value.
- Revoke a key: Open a key’s menu → Revoke. This action is immediate.
- Rotate a key: Create a new key, update clients, then revoke the old key.

## Security Tips

- Store keys in a secrets manager, not in source control.
- Scope keys to the minimal permissions needed and rotate regularly.
