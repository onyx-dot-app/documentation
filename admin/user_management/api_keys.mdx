API Keys provide programmatic access to Onyx APIs, enabling you to build custom applications,
integrate with external systems, and automate workflows.

<Note>
  API Keys exist as distinct users in Onyx, allowing you to trace activity and manage permissions at the key level.
</Note>

## API Key Types

There are three types of API keys:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Admin API Keys" icon="shield-check">
    Can access all endpoints, including those pre-fixed with `admin/`.

    **Use cases:**
    - Full system administration
    - User management operations
    - Data management and analytics
    - Complete access to all Onyx features

    **⚠️ Use with caution:** Admin keys have unrestricted access to your Onyx instance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Basic API Keys" icon="key">
    Can access the non-admin endpoints like Search, Chat, Agents, and Actions.

    **Use cases:**
    - Building chat applications
    - Implementing search functionality
    - Creating and managing agents
    - Running actions and workflows

    **✅ Recommended:** Most users should use Basic API Keys for application development.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limited API Keys" icon="lock">
    Read-only Agent access. Can post messages to Chat endpoints, but cannot read chat history.

    **Use cases:**
    - Highly restricted environments
    - Specific use cases requiring minimal permissions
    - Testing with limited scope
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Coming soon:** User-Scoped Token tied to a specific user's permissions and data access.
