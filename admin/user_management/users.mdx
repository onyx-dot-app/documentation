## Overview

Use the Users page to view all users in your workspace, invite new users, promote/demote admins,
and deactivate accounts.

## Common Tasks

- Invite a user: Click Invite, enter email, choose role, and send.
- Change role: Select a user → Edit → toggle Admin.
- Deactivate user: Select a user → More → Deactivate.
- Reset password: Select a user → More → Reset password (email link sent).

## Tips

- SCIM/SSO managed users may be read-only and controlled by your IdP.
- Deactivating preserves historical analytics; deleting removes the account entirely.
