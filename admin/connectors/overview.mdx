## What are Connectors?

Connectors are the bridge between Onyx and your organization's data sources. They allow Onyx to ingest, index, and search through your data to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries.

## Key Benefits

### **Centralized Knowledge Access**
Connectors enable Onyx to access information from multiple systems through a single interface, eliminating the need to search across different platforms.

### **Real-time Synchronization**
Connected data sources are automatically synchronized, ensuring Onyx always has access to the most recent information.

### **Permission Preservation**
Connectors respect existing access permissions from the source systems, ensuring users only see information they're authorized to access.

### **Comprehensive Coverage**
With support for 50+ connectors, Onyx can connect to virtually any data source in your organization.

## Setting Up Connectors

### **1. Choose Your Connectors**
Browse the [Supported Connectors](/admin/connectors/supported) section to see all available options. Each connector has specific setup requirements and authentication methods.

### **2. Configure Authentication**
Most connectors require authentication credentials. Common methods include:
- **OAuth 2.0**: For services like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack
- **API Keys**: For services like GitHub, GitLab, Jira
- **Service Accounts**: For enterprise Google Workspace deployments
- **Access Keys**: For cloud storage services like AWS S3

### **3. Define Sync Settings**
Configure how often and what data should be synchronized:
- **Sync Frequency**: How often to check for updates
- **Content Filters**: What types of content to include/exclude
- **Date Ranges**: Historical data limits
- **Permission Scopes**: Which users/groups can access the data

### **4. Monitor and Maintain**
- Track sync status and errors
- Monitor data volume and performance
- Update credentials when they expire
- Adjust settings based on usage patterns

## Best Practices

### **Start Small**
Begin with 2-3 high-value data sources and expand gradually based on user feedback and usage patterns.

### **Plan Your Permissions**
Consider how connector permissions align with your organization's access policies and user roles.

### **Monitor Performance**
Track sync times, data volume, and user query performance to optimize your connector configuration.

### **Regular Maintenance**
- Update expired credentials promptly
- Review and clean up unused connectors
- Monitor for new connector releases and features

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### **Authentication Errors**
- Verify credentials are correct and not expired
- Check if the service requires additional setup (e.g., OAuth consent screen)
- Ensure proper permissions are granted

### **Sync Failures**
- Check network connectivity to the data source
- Verify rate limits aren't being exceeded
- Review error logs for specific failure reasons

### **Performance Issues**
- Consider reducing sync frequency for large data sources
- Implement content filters to reduce data volume
- Monitor resource usage during sync operations
