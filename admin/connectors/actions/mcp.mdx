## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI assistants to interact with tools and services in a consistent way. MCP actions in Onyx allow you to connect your assistant to development tools, databases, and other systems that support the MCP protocol.

## Key Features

### **Tool Integration**
Connect to MCP-compatible tools and services for enhanced functionality.

### **Standardized Interface**
Use a consistent protocol for interacting with different tools and services.

### **Rich Interactions**
Enable complex workflows and multi-step operations across multiple systems.

### **Development Focus**
Perfect for development teams who want to integrate AI with their existing toolchain.

## Supported MCP Tools

### **Development Tools**
- Git repositories and version control
- Code editors and IDEs
- Build systems and CI/CD pipelines
- Testing frameworks

### **Database Systems**
- SQL databases
- NoSQL databases
- Data warehouses
- Analytics platforms

### **Infrastructure**
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)
- Monitoring and logging systems
- Configuration management

### **Communication**
- Chat platforms
- Email systems
- Video conferencing tools
- Project management platforms

## Setup Process

### **1. Install MCP Server**
Install the MCP server for your target tool or service.

### **2. Configure Connection**
Set up the connection parameters and authentication for your MCP server.

### **3. Define Actions**
Specify which MCP operations your assistant can perform.

### **4. Test Integration**
Verify that the MCP actions work correctly with your target systems.

## Configuration Example

```yaml
mcp_actions:
  - name: "git_operations"
    server: "mcp-git-server"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3000
    actions:
      - "commit"
      - "push"
      - "pull"
      - "create_branch"
  
  - name: "database_operations"
    server: "mcp-database-server"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3001
    actions:
      - "query"
      - "insert"
      - "update"
      - "delete"
```

## Security Considerations

- MCP servers can have significant access to your systems
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use secure connections (TLS/SSL) when possible
- Regularly audit MCP server permissions and access

## Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**
- Verify MCP server is running and accessible
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Ensure proper authentication credentials

### **Action Failures**
- Review MCP server logs for error details
- Check permissions and access rights
- Verify action parameters and syntax

### **Performance Issues**
- Monitor MCP server resource usage
- Consider connection pooling for high-volume operations
- Implement appropriate timeouts and retry logic

## Best Practices

### **Access Control**
- Limit MCP server permissions to minimum required access
- Use service accounts with specific roles and permissions
- Regularly review and update access controls

### **Monitoring**
- Set up logging and monitoring for MCP operations
- Track usage patterns and performance metrics
- Implement alerting for critical failures

### **Testing**
- Test MCP actions in a development environment first
- Use mock data and test scenarios
- Validate results and error handling
