## What's Coming

### **Community Contributions**

- **Collaborative Development**: Work together on connector improvements and new integrations

### **Custom Connector Support**
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clear guidelines and documentation for building custom connectors

## Important Disclaimer

**Community Support**: Community connectors are developed and maintained by the open-source community, not the official Onyx team. While we provide the platform and guidelines, these connectors are:

- **Community Maintained**: Support and updates are provided by community contributors
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: No official warranty or support guarantees
- **Variable Quality**: Quality may vary depending on the contributor and community testing
- **Security Considerations**: Review community connectors carefully before deployment

## Current Status

We're actively working on the infrastructure to support community connectors safely and effectively. This includes:

- **Security Framework**: Ensuring community connectors can't compromise your Onyx deployment
- **Quality Guidelines**: Standards for code quality, documentation, and testing
- **Review Process**: Community-driven review and approval workflow
- **Installation System**: Safe and easy installation of community connectors
