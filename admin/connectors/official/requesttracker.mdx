## How it works

The Request Tracker connector will pull in all tickets updated within the last 10 minutes into the dataset.

Tickets are updated every **10** minutes.

Only Request Tracker REST API 1.0 is supported at this time. REST API 1.0 is implemented in Request Tracker 4.x,
Request Tracker 5.x is not supported currently.
