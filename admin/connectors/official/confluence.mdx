  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Confluence setup">
    For Confluence setup, you must provide:
    - **Wiki Base URL**: The base URL of your Confluence instance (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki)
    - **Whether you're using Confluence Cloud or Datacenter**: Check the `Is Cloud` box if you are using a Confluence Cloud instance, uncheck for Confluence Server/Data Center
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose indexing scope">
    Then choose how you'd like this connector to index your Confluence instance:
    - Everything:
    - If you select this option, the connector will index everything the provided credentials
    have access to.
    - Space:
    - Input the key of the space you'd like to index (e.g., `KB`)
    - Page:
    - Page ID: Specific page ID to index - leave empty to index the entire space (e.g., `131368` for a specific page)
    - Index Recursively: Check this box to index the specified page AND all of its children.
    - CQL Query:
    - If you'd like finer control over what is indexed, you can use a CQL query. The query must contain 'type=page' and any lastmodified filters will be overwritten. See the [CQL documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/) for more information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect">
    Click the `Connect` button!
    All the specified spaces/pages and related comments will now be pulled into Onyx every **10** minutes.
  </Step>

syncing, the provided credentials must be from an admin user.
