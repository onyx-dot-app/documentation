## How it works

The SharePoint connector will go through all configured sites belonging to an organization and index all the documents
attached to that site. Note, it currently does not parse the site page contents, only the attached files.

This includes:

- Word Doc, Excel, PDF, PowerPoints, and all plaintext files like .txt, .mdx, etc.

## Setting up

### Authorization

We support two authorization methodsâ€”pick one that fits your environment:

- [Client Secret Authentication](/admin/connectors/official/sharepoint/client-secret)
  - Uses traditional client
  secret credentials
- [Certificate-Based Authentication](/admin/connectors/official/sharepoint/certificate)
  - Uses certificate-based
  authentication (required for permission sync)

**Note:** Permission sync is only available with certificate-based authentication.

### Indexing

Once you've set up your authorization method, follow these steps to index your SharePoint sites:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open SharePoint connector">
    Navigate to the Onyx Admin Panel and select the **SharePoint** Connector.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure authorization">
    In **Step 1**, configure your authorization:
    - If you have existing credentials, select them from the list
    - If you don't have existing credentials, click **Create New** to add new authorization:
    - **Client Secret**: Enter your Application ID, Directory ID, and Client Secret
    - **Certificate**: Upload your certificate file and enter Application/Directory IDs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save configuration">
    Click **Create** to save your configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue with selected credential">
    Ensure your chosen credential is selected, then click **Continue**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify SharePoint configuration">
    In **Step 2**, specify your SharePoint configuration:
    - **Connector Name**: Enter a name for the connector (e.g., "MySharePointConnector")
    - **Sites**: Select a list of sites to pull from or leave blank to pull everything
    - **Permission Sync** (Certificate auth only): Enable to sync SharePoint permissions with Onyx
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create connector">
    Click **Create Connector** to begin indexing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The connector will start indexing your SharePoint sites and you can add more sites or modify settings as needed.

## Understanding SharePoint Structure

SharePoint organizes content into sites, which can contain document libraries, lists, and pages.
Each site can contain an unlimited number of documents.
The connector focuses on indexing documents stored in document libraries across your selected sites.
