## How it works

The File Connector indexes user uploaded files. Currently supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`,
`.md`, `.mdx`, `.conf`, `.log`, `.json`, `.tsv`, `.xml`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.eml`, and `.epub` files.
You can also upload a `.zip` containing these files - If there are other file types in the zip,
the other file types are ignored. There is also an optional metadata line that supports links, document owners,
and time updated as metadata for Onyx's retrieval and AI Answer.

## Adding Metadata

The metadata line should be placed at the very top of the file and can take one of two formats:

- `#ONYX_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"}`
- `<!-- ONYX_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"} -->`

Where ONYX_METADATA= is followed by a json. The valid json keys are:

- link
- primary_owners
- secondary_owners
- doc_updated_at
- file_display_name

You can also include arbitrary key/value pairs which will be understood as "tags".
These tags can then be used in the UI as a filter if you want to constrain your search / conversation to only documents
with certain tag(s) attached

For example:

```
#ONYX_METADATA={"link": "https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md", "primary_owners": ["yuhong@onyx.app", "chris@onyx.app"], "secondary_owners": ["founders@onyx.app"], "doc_updated_at": "2023-11-30T13:06:08.589616-08:00", "file_display_name": "Desired File Name!", "tag_of_your_choice": "tag_value"}
```

Full file example:

```
#ONYX_METADATA={"link": "https://www.onyx.com/captcha", "file_display_name": "Captcha Setup"}

As we can see, there are many web pages or internal tools that aren't directly scrape-able.
In addition to handling local file uploads,
the file connector is offered as an option for these tools which may have APIs for accessing the contents.

Alternatively, if you are uploading a `.zip` filled with files,
you can define a `.onyx_metadata.json` file and include that in the root of the zip file.
If your zip file structure looks like:

```
| file1.txt
| file2.txt
| .onyx_metadata.json
```

then your `.onyx_metadata.json` file might look like:

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "file1.txt",
    "link": "<LINK_TO_FILE1>",
    "file_display_name": "<WHAT_YOU_WANT_THE_NAME_OF_FILE1_TO_BE_IN_THE_UI>"},
    "primary_owners": ["<FILE1_OWNER>"],
    // this is an arbitrary tag, can be any key/value pair and can be used in the UI as
    // a filter if you want to constrain your search / conversation to only documents with
    // this tag attached
    "status": "<SOME_STATUS>"
  },
  {
    "filename": "file2.txt",
    "link": "<LINK_TO_FILE2>",
    "file_display_name": "<WHAT_YOU_WANT_THE_NAME_OF_FILE2_TO_BE_IN_THE_UI>"},
    "primary_owners": ["<FILE2_OWNER>"],
    // this is an arbitrary tag, can be any key/value pair and can be used in the UI as
    // a filter if you want to constrain your search / conversation to only documents with
    // this tag attached
    "status": "<SOME_OTHER_STATUS>"
  }
]
```

## Setting up

### Authorization

    - No external auth flows required.
    - Admins can upload files and make them available to everyone
    - [WIP] Admins or normal users will be able to upload files via personal connectors and make
      them accessible for just themselves.

### Indexing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open File connector">
    Navigate to the Admin Panel and select the **File** Connector.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload file">
    Select a `.txt` file or a `.zip` file and click
