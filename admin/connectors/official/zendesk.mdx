## How it works

The Zendesk Connector can sync content from your Zendesk instance, supporting two content types:

- **Articles**: Syncs all published Articles from your company's Help Center
- **Tickets**: Syncs Support Tickets with their comments and metadata

The connector supports incremental updates and maintains author information, content tags, and other metadata.

## Content Types

### Articles

- Syncs all published articles from Zendesk Help Center
- Includes article content, labels, and content tags
- Tracks author information and update timestamps
- Skips draft articles and articles with specific skip labels (configurable)

### Tickets

- Syncs support tickets with full comment threads
- Includes ticket metadata (status, priority, tags, type)
- Tracks submitter and commenter information
- Excludes deleted tickets
- **Note**: Requires active Zendesk Support Product

## Current Limitations

- Articles: Does not allow filtering by specific categories or sections
- Tickets: Requires Zendesk Support Product to be active

## Setting up

### Authorization

The Zendesk Connector requires 3 things to connect:
- **Subdomain**: Your Zendesk subdomain (e.g., `your-company` from `your-company.zendesk.com`)
- **Email**: Email address of the API token owner
- **API Token**: Zendesk API token for authentication

See below for instructions on getting the API token:

### Indexing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Zendesk connector">
    Navigate to the **Admin Panel** and select `Add Connector` followed by the Zendesk tile
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose content type">
    Choose your content type (Articles or Tickets)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide authentication">
    Provide the authentication information from the section above
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start syncing">
    Click connect to start syncing content from Zendesk
  </Step>
</Steps>

The connector will perform incremental syncs to keep content up to date,
using cursor-based pagination for articles and timestamp-based retrieval for tickets.

## Metadata

The connector extracts and indexes the following metadata:

### Articles

- Labels (article labels)
- Content tags
- Author information
- Update timestamps

### Tickets

- Status (open, pending, solved, etc.)
- Priority level
- Tags
- Ticket type
- Submitter information
- Comment history with authors and timestamps
