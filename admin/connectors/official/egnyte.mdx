## How it works

The Egnyte connector pulls in files stored in Egnyte. The Egnyte connector indexes the file name, file type,
and contents of the file.

New files are pulled every **10** minutes.

## Setup

### Configure your Egnyte Application + Onyx env variables

  This is only necessary if self-hosting Onyx. If using [Onyx Cloud](https://cloud.onyx.app), you can skip this step.
