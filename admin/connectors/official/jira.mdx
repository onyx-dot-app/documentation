## How it works

The Jira connector pulls in all tickets from the specified projects every **10** minutes.

For every jira issue this connector will pull:

- Title
- Description
- [Common fields](#indexed-metadata)
- Comments

## Setting up

### Authorization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Jira Cloud token">
    **Jira Cloud**:
    follow the guide described
    [here](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Atlassian-Jira-Confluence-Authentication-Create-API-Token.htm)
    to get an access token.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Jira Server token">
    **Jira Server**:
    follow the guide described
    [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html)
    to get a personal access token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Indexing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Jira connector">
    Navigate to the Admin Panel and select the **Jira** Connector
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide credentials">
    For Cloud, provide the **Access Token** and the **Username** it belongs to:

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/images/connectors/jira/JiraCloudAuth.png" alt="JiraConnectorAuth" />

    For Server, provide the **Personal Access Token**:

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/images/connectors/jira/JiraServerAuth.png" alt="JiraConnectorAuth" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose projects and filters">
    For each project you want to index, provide a single URL to any page in the project.
    Optionally specify users whose comments should not be indexed (useful to ignore certain bots). For example:

    <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/images/connectors/jira/JiraIndex.png" alt="JiraIndex" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start indexing">
    Click the `Connect` button! All your Jira tickets in that space will now be pulled into Onyx every **10** minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>
