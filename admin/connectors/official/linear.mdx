## How it works

The Linear connector pulls in all the Linear issues and the associated comments.

Issues are updated every **10** minutes.

## Setup

### Configure your Linear Application + Onyx env variables

<Info>
  This is only necessary if self-hosting Onyx. If using [Onyx Cloud](https://cloud.onyx.app), you can skip this step.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Linear application">
    [Create a Linear Application.](https://linear.app/settings/api/applications/new)
    This step must be completed by an admin of the Linear workspace you wish to connect to Onyx.
    The application callback URLs should include `<your onyx host>/connector/oauth/callback/linear`. For example,
    for a local deployment with default configurations one of the lines should be
    `http://localhost:3000/connector/oauth/callback/linear`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set environment variables">
    Set the following environment variables on your Onyx instance using the Client ID and Signing Secret provided by
    Linear for your new app:

```bash
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Onyx">
    Restart your Onyx instance as you normally would to apply the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>
