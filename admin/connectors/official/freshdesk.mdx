  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Onyx">
    Once you have the API key, you can use it (as well as your domain) to authorize your Onyx connector.
    The [password field is unused when the API key is provided](https://developers.freshdesk.com/api/#authentication)
    and will be removed in a future version of Onyx. For now, please enter abc into the password field.
