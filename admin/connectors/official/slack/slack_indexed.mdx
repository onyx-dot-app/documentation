## June 2025 Update

Slack has changed their Terms of Service, preventing users from indexing their data (source: [Slack](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api)).

This change prevents new Onyx users from indexing their messages. However, existing users can continue to use the legacy Slack connector until Fall 2025.

For those new to Onyx, check out our Federated Slack Connector to get around these restrictions. 

If you have any questions, please reach out to [founders@onyx.app](mailto:founders@onyx.app) or send us a message in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/onyx-dot-app/shared_invite/zt-34lu4m7xg-TsKGO6h8PDvR5W27zTdyhA).

## How it works

The Slack connector indexes all public channels for a given workspace.

- Upcoming: Support for private channels by tagging/adding the Onyx Slack Bot to private channels.

## Setting up

**Note:** The first indexing pulls all of the public channels and takes longer than future updates.
