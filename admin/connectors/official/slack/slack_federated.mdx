## June 2025 Update

Slack has changed their Terms of Service, preventing users from indexing their data (source:
[Slack](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api)). As a result,
the only way to add Slack information into Onyx is by using the `search` APIs that Slack provides.

These APIs are significantly slower and lower quality than the previous index-based approach.

Your data is your data â€” if you care about higher quality Slack search then please talk to your customer success
representative and make it clear that this change reduces the value you get out of Slack.

If you have any questions, please reach out to founders@onyx.app or send us a message in Slack.
