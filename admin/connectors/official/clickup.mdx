## How it works

The ClickUp connector will pull in all tasks from the ClickUp workspace, or specific space(s), list(s), folder(s)
specified by the user.

Tasks are updated every **10** minutes.

## Understanding ClickUp Hierarchy

In Clickup, there are multiple containers which contain task(s). These could be -
* Entire Workspace
* Spaces
* Folders
* Lists

Detailed information on the hierarchy of above mentioned objects is available
