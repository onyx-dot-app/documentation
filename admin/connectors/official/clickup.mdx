## How it works
The ClickUp connector will pull in all tasks from the ClickUp workspace, or specific space(s), list(s), folder(s) specified by the user.

Tasks are updated every **10** minutes.

## Understanding ClickUp Hierarchy
In Clickup, there are multiple containers which contain task(s). These could be -
* Entire Workspace
* Spaces
* Folders
* Lists

Detailed information on the hierarchy of above mentioned objects is available [here](https://help.clickup.com/hc/en-us/articles/13856392825367-Intro-to-the-Hierarchy)

3. Select the type of connector you want to pull in tasks from.

**Notes**
* This could be Entire Worspace, Space(s), List(s), or Folder(s).
* To pull tasks from entire workspace, just select Entire Workspace from the dropdown, and do not add any ID(s).
* To pull tasks from specific space(s), folder(s), or lists(s), select the respective option from the dropdown, and add the ID(s) below. At least one ID needs to be added in this case.
* The space id(s), folder id(s), list id(s) could be found in the web url in Clickup.
For example, if you open a **list** in the ClickUp UI, you will see the list id in the url address bar as follows -

5. Check **Retrieve Task Comments?** to also retrieve and index all comments for each indexed task. Leave this unchecked if you dont want to index task comments.

6. Click `Connect` to begin indexing.
