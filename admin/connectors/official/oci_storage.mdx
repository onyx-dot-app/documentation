## How it works

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Storage connector pulls in all documents from the specified OCI bucket.
It supports various file formats including PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, and more.

Documents are updated every **1** day.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Object Storage namespace">
    To find your tenancy's Object Storage namespace, click on the user icon in the top-right corner and select "Tenancy:
    [your tenancy name]". In the tenancy details, you'll find the Object Storage namespace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Indexing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open OCI Storage connector">
    Navigate to the Admin Panel and select the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Storage** Connector.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter OCI credentials">
    In **Step 1**, provide your OCI credentials:

## Understanding Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Structure

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage organizes data into buckets.
Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects (files). You can think of a bucket as a root directory,
and the objects as files within that directory.

For more information on OCI Object Storage structure,
visit the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage
documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Concepts/objectstorageoverview.htm).
