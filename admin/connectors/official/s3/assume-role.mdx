title: S3 Assume Role
description: "This method automatically uses the IAM role attached to your EC2 instance to access S3 buckets. No manual credential entry is required."

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure your EC2 instance has an IAM role attached.
2. Verify the instance profile is properly configured via AWS Console under **EC2 › Instance Settings › Attach/Replace IAM role**.

### Updating the Existing IAM Role

Since your EC2 instance already has an IAM role attached, you need to update it with the necessary S3 permissions:

1. In AWS Console, go to **IAM › Roles** and find your EC2 instance's existing role.
2. Click on the role and go to the **Permissions** tab.
3. Click **Add permissions › Attach policies**.
4. Search for and select **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy.
5. Click **Attach policies** to add S3 access permissions to your existing role.

Alternatively, for more granular control, you can create a custom inline policy:

1. In the same role's **Permissions** tab, click **Add permissions › Create inline policy**.
2. Switch to JSON and add this policy (replace `your-source-bucket-name`):
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-source-bucket-name",
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-source-bucket-name/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Name the policy (e.g., `OnyxS3Access`) and click **Create policy**.

The connector will automatically detect and use the EC2 instance's IAM role for accessing your S3 buckets.

### Credential Entry in Onyx

When configuring the S3 connector in Onyx, you'll need to:
1. Click on the **Assume Role** tab
2. No credentials need to be entered - the connector automatically uses your EC2 instance's attached role

Once you have updated your EC2 instance's role with S3 permissions, proceed to the [indexing steps in the overview](./overview#indexing) to configure your S3 connector.
