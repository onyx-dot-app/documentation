## How it works

The Bitbucket Connector indexes all Pull Requests from a specified Bitbucket Cloud repository, project, or entire workspace.

- It indexes `OPEN`, `MERGED`, and `DECLINED` pull requests, including their titles and descriptions.
- It also captures key metadata such as the author, reviewers, current state, creation/update timestamps, and a direct link back to the original pull request in Bitbucket.

## Setting up

### Authorization

The Bitbucket Connector uses an API Token for authentication.

To create an API token:
1. Log in to your Bitbucket account.
2. Select the **Settings** cog in the upper-right corner of the top navigation bar.
3. Under **Personal settings**, select **Atlassian account settings**.
4. Select the **Security** tab on the top navigation bar.
5. Select **Create and manage API tokens**.
6. Select **Create API token with scopes**.
7. Give the API token a name and an expiry date, usually related to the application that will use the token and select **Next**.
8. Select **Bitbucket** as the app and select **Next**.
9. Select the scopes (permissions) the API token needs and select **Next**.
    -   **Projects**: `read:project:bitbucket`
    -   **Repositories**: `read:repository:bitbucket`
    -   **Pull Requests**: `read:pullrequest:bitbucket`
10. Review your token and select the *Create token* button. The page will display the New API token.
11. Copy the generated API token and either record or paste it into the application you want to give access.
<Note>
The token is only displayed once and can't be retrieved later.
