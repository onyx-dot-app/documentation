## How it works

The Github Connector picks up all of the Pull Requests and Issues in a specified repository.

- It will index both Open and Closed PRs. This includes the Title and Summary.
- It will index Issues and comments both Open and Closed
- Includes certain other metadata such as the URL, creator, etc.

## Setting up

### Authorization

    1. This Connector uses a GitHub Access Token.
        - [This guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) shows the following steps in detail.
    2. Log in to GitHub.
    3. In the upper right corner, expand your profile and click on **Settings**
    4. On the bottom, go to **Developer settings** -> **Personal access tokens** -> **Tokens (classic)**
    5. Click on **Generate new token**
        - Be sure to give the Token `repo` access so that it can access the PRs.
        - Set any expiration time. A new token will have to be provided to Onyx to continue updating the Onyx
        index once this one expires.

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **GitHub** Connector
    2. For [https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx), it would look like:
