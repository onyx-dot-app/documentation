## How it works

The Github Connector picks up all of the Pull Requests and Issues in a specified repository.

- It will index both Open and Closed PRs. This includes the Title and Summary.
- It will index Issues and comments both Open and Closed
- Includes certain other metadata such as the URL, creator, etc.

## Permission Sync Feature

The GitHub connector supports permission synchronization,
which ensures that users can only access documents they have permissions to view in GitHub. When enabled, this feature:

- Syncs user permissions from GitHub repositories and organizations
- Ensures that users only see search results for repositories they have access to
- Maintains consistent access control between GitHub and Onyx

<Note>
  Permission sync is available only on Cloud and the Enterprise Edition of Onyx,
  and it requires additional token permissions beyond those needed for basic indexing.
</Note>

### ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Public Email Profile

<Info>
  **VERY IMPORTANT:** For permission sync to work,
  users must have their email address publicly visible in their GitHub profile. If a user's email is set to private,
  they will not get access to any documents through Onyx.
</Info>

How to Make Your Email Public on GitHub:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to GitHub">
    Log in to your GitHub account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access profile settings">
    Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to email settings">
    In the left sidebar, click on **Emails**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable public email">
    Scroll down to **Keep my email addresses private** and **uncheck this option**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure public profile">
    Now go back to the left sidebar and click on **Public profile**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set public email">
    Scroll down to the **Public email** section and select your email address from the dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click **Update profile** to save the changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Why is this required?**

Onyx uses the public email to match GitHub users with Onyx users for permission synchronization. Without a public email,
the system cannot identify which GitHub permissions apply to which Onyx user.

## Setting up

### Authorization

This Connector uses a GitHub Access Token.
The required permissions depend on whether you're using the permission sync feature.

#### Basic Setup (Indexing Only)

For basic indexing without permission sync:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review detailed guide">
    [This
    guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
    shows the following steps in detail.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in to GitHub">
    Log in to GitHub.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access settings">
    In the upper right corner, expand your profile and click on **Settings**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to developer settings">
    On the bottom, go to **Developer settings** -> **Personal access tokens** -> **Tokens (classic)**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate new token">
    Click on **Generate new token**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    Grant the following permissions:
    - **Repository permissions:**
    - `repo` (Full control of private repositories) - to access PRs and issues
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Permission Sync Setup

For permission sync functionality, you need additional permissions:

**Repository permissions:**
- **Administration:** Read access
- **Issues:** Read access
- **Metadata:** Read access
- **Pull requests:** Read access

**Organization permissions:**
- **Administration:** Read only
- **Members:** Read only

#### Token Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set expiration time">
    Set any expiration time.
    A new token will have to be provided to Onyx to continue updating the Onyx index once this one expires.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify permissions">
    **Important:** If you plan to use permission sync,
    ensure all the above permissions are granted when creating the token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Indexing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to connector">
    Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **GitHub** Connector
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure connector">
