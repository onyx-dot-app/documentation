## How it works

The Web Connector scrapes sites based on a base URL.
    - It only indexes files from the same domain and containing the same base path.
    - It will index pages reachable via hyperlinks from the base URL.
    - The text contents are cleaned up via some heuristics and some metadata such as the page Title
      is extracted.

## Setting up

### Authorization

    - As long as the page is reachable, no additional authorization is necessary.
