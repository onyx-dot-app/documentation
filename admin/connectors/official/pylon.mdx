## How it works

The Pylon Connector indexes data from a specified Pylon account.
It supports issues and, optionally, related messages and attachments.
Issues can only be retrieved by their creation date, consider adjusting the Lookback Days for tracking activity.

- It indexes all issues starting from a specified date. This includes text, title and metadata such as assignee, state, creation/update timestamps, and a direct link back to the original issue in Pylon.
- It also supports indexing messages and attachments related to the issues. Attachments are embedded into resulting focuments, text and images are extracted, and images are saved as files. If image processing is enabled in Onyx, then a summary for images will be retrieved.


## Setting up

<Note>
  Other data such as knowledge base articles is not supported at the moment since it is not accessible via the Pylon API.
</Note>
