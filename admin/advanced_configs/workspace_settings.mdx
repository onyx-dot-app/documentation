## Overview

Workspace Settings control organization‑wide behaviors like branding, default roles, security, and privacy.
These settings apply to all users unless otherwise scoped.

## Common Tasks

- Update organization name and logo
- Configure allowed domains and invite settings
- Set default user role and permissions
- Configure time zone, locale, and language defaults
- Adjust session timeout and authentication requirements
- Manage notification and email preferences

## Tips

- Pair branding here with Advanced Configs → White-labeling for a consistent experience.
- Changes to security or session policies take effect immediately for new sessions.
