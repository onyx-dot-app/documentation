White labeling allows you to customize Onyx's branding and appearance to match your organization's identity. 
Available as part of the Enterprise Edition, these features help create a seamless, branded experience for your users.

## Customization Options

White labeling in Onyx provides two main types of customization:

1. **Application Branding**: Custom name, logo, and visual identity
2. **Color Theming**: Complete control over the UI color palette

## Application Branding

### Basic Branding

Navigate to the **White Labeling** tab in the Admin Panel to configure your basic branding options:

- **Application Name**: Replace "Onyx" with your organization's name throughout the interface
- **Logo**: Upload your custom logo to appear in the header and other key locations

### Advanced Content Customization

Onyx provides several advanced options for customizing user-facing content:

#### Chat Header Content
Add custom Markdown content that displays as a banner at the top of the Chat page. 
This is useful for announcements, usage guidelines, or organizational messaging.

- **Popup Header**: Custom title for the initial visit popup. If left blank with custom content specified, defaults to "Welcome to [Application Name]!"
- **Popup Content**: Custom Markdown content displayed in the welcome popup

## Color Theming

Onyx uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for its theming system, providing flexible color customization options.

### Theme Architecture

The color system is built on two main files:

- `web/tailwind-themes/tailwind.config.js`: Base Tailwind configuration and color definitions
- `web/src/app/globals.css`: CSS variables for colors used in the Tailwind config

### Customization Methods

#### Method 1: Direct CSS Variable Modification

1. Navigate to `web/src/app/globals.css`
2. Modify the CSS variables to customize base colors (accent colors, backgrounds, etc.)

#### Method 2: Tailwind Config Override

1. Navigate to `web/tailwind-themes/tailwind.config.js`
2. Override specific values from the base configuration

#### Method 3: Organization-Specific Theme (Recommended)

For comprehensive theming:

1. Navigate to `web/tailwind-themes/`
2. Create a new folder with your organization's name
3. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in this folder
4. Override any values from the base configuration
5. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME` environment variable to your organization's folder name

### Example Configuration

To change the background to black, create or modify your theme file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        "background": "#000000",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

<Warning>
  Color customizations require building Onyx from source. For local testing, restart the NextJS application to apply changes.
</Warning>

## Implementation Notes

<Note>
  White labeling features are exclusive to the Enterprise Edition of Onyx.
</Note>

To apply theme changes:

1. **Source Build Required**: Custom themes require building Onyx from source
2. **Development**: Restart the NextJS application locally to see changes
3. **Production**: Rebuild and redeploy your Onyx instance
