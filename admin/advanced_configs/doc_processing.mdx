## Overview

Onyx has a built-in document parser that can process a wide range of document types. However,
you may have certain documents that need advanced processing such as large tables, OCR files,
or PDFs with complex layouts and rich media.

In these cases, you can configure the document processing settings to use a third party document processing service.

<Tip>
  Currently, Unstructured is the only third party document processing service that is supported. However,
  we are open to adding more services in the future!
</Tip>

### Unstructured

To configure Onyx to use Unstructured, just set the API key in the **Document Processing** section.
