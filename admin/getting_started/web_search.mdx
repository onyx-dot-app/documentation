Enable your AI agents to search the web for real-time information by configuring the Web Search action in Onyx. This extends your agents' capabilities beyond internal knowledge to include current web content.

## How It Works

The Web Search action uses the [Exa](https://exa.ai) API to search the web. When enabled, AI agents equipped with Web Search will automatically analyze user queries and determine when to search the web for additional context or real-time information.

Key features:
- **Intelligent Query Analysis**: Agents automatically decide when web search is needed
- **Seamless Integration**: Web results are displayed alongside internal search results
- **Real-time Information**: Access to current web content and recent developments
- **Source Attribution**: Clear citations showing web sources used in responses

Currently, Exa is the only supported provider. If you would like to use or contribute a new provider, please let us know in our [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/onyx-dot-app/shared_invite/zt-34lu4m7xg-TsKGO6h8PDvR5W27zTdyhA).

## Configuration

### **Onyx Cloud**
Web Search is available by default for Onyx Cloud deployments! No additional configuration is required - you can skip directly to [Agent Setup](#agent-setup).

### **Self-Hosted Deployments**
To enable Web Search for self-hosted Onyx, follow these steps:

1. **Create Exa Account**: Sign up for an account at [Exa](https://exa.ai)
2. **Generate API Key**: Create an API key in your Exa dashboard
3. **Configure Environment Variable**: Add the following environment variable to your Onyx deployment:
   ```bash
   EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
   ```
4. **Restart Services**: Restart your Onyx deployment to apply the new configuration

## Agent Setup

Once Web Search is configured at the deployment level, you can enable it for specific AI agents:

1. **Navigate to Agents**: Go to the Admin Panel and select **Agents**
2. **Create or Edit Agent**: Choose an existing agent or create a new one
3. **Enable Web Search**: On the agent creation/update page, check the "Web Search" checkbox
4. **Save Configuration**: Save your agent settings

## Usage and Behavior

### **Automatic Decision Making**
Agents with Web Search enabled will automatically analyze user queries and determine when web search is appropriate. They consider factors like:
- Whether the query requires current/real-time information
- If the internal knowledge base lacks relevant information
- The nature of the question (news, current events, recent developments)

### **Search Results Integration**
When Web Search is triggered:
- Web results are seamlessly integrated with internal search results
- Source citations clearly indicate web sources vs. internal documents
- Results maintain the same format and presentation as internal content

### **User Experience**
From the user perspective:
- No additional steps or commands are required
- Agents transparently decide when to use web search
- Responses combine internal knowledge with relevant web information
- All sources are properly attributed and cited

## Best Practices

### **Agent Configuration**
- **Enable selectively**: Not all agents need Web Search - enable it based on use case
- **Specialized agents**: Consider creating dedicated agents for research or current events
- **Clear instructions**: Provide agents with clear guidelines about when to use web search

### **Use Cases**
Web Search is particularly valuable for:
- **Research agents**: Market research, competitive analysis, industry trends
- **News and current events**: Latest developments, breaking news, recent updates
- **Technical support**: Latest software updates, recent bug fixes, new solutions
- **Sales intelligence**: Recent company news, market conditions, industry developments

### **Monitoring and Management**
- **Review usage**: Monitor which agents are using Web Search most frequently
- **Cost considerations**: Be aware that web searches consume API credits with Exa
- **Quality control**: Review web search results to ensure relevance and accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### **Web Search Not Working**
- Verify the `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable is correctly set
- Check that your Exa account has sufficient API credits
- Ensure the Onyx deployment has been restarted after adding the API key
- Confirm the agent has Web Search enabled in its configuration

### **Poor Search Results**
- Review agent instructions to provide better context for when to use web search
- Consider refining user queries to be more specific
- Check if the internal knowledge base needs updating to reduce reliance on web search

### **API Limits and Costs**
- Monitor your Exa API usage through their dashboard
- Set up usage alerts to track consumption
- Consider usage policies for different agent types
