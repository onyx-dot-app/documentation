**Actions** extend your agents beyond basic conversation by enabling them to perform specific tasks and interact with
external systems.

## What are Actions?

Actions are additional capabilities that you can give to AI agents. They allow agents to:

- **Fetch information** from external sources (databases, APIs, or the Web)
- **Perform operations** (write to databases, send emails, update systems)
- **Generate content** (create images, generate plots, produce documents)

## Built-in Actions

Onyx comes with several pre-configured actions:

- **Knowledge**: The core search capability that allows agents to access your connected data sources
  through connectors
- **Image Generation**: Enables agents to create images using DALL-E 3
- **Web Search**: Allows agents to search the web for real-time information

## Managing Actions

As an administrator, you can:

- **Enable/Disable Actions**: Control which actions are available to your agents
- **Configure Settings**: Set up API keys, endpoints, and other configuration options
- **Monitor Usage**: Track how actions are being used across your organization
- **Create Custom Actions**: Build specialized actions for your specific workflows

## Custom Actions

Beyond the built-in actions, you can create custom actions tailored to your organization's needs.
Custom actions can integrate with your internal systems, APIs, and business processes to create powerful,
specialized AI agents.
