The Enterprise Edition of Onyx provides advanced security, management,
and customization features designed for organizations with sophisticated requirements.
Enterprise customers get access to enhanced security controls, comprehensive analytics, priority support,
and professional services.

## Security Features

### **Permission Inheritance**

Configure app connectors to automatically inherit permissions from external applications into Onyx.
When users ask questions, answers and documents will reflect only what they have access to externally,
maintaining security boundaries while enabling comprehensive knowledge access.

This feature allows teams to connect sensitive knowledge sources with confidence,
knowing that existing access controls are preserved and enforced within Onyx.

### **Encryption of Secrets**

All sensitive keys and access tokens are encrypted before storage in the database,
providing an additional security layer in case of database compromise.

**Protected Information:**
- LLM API keys
- Connector credentials
- External embedding provider keys
- Other sensitive configuration data

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Fine-grained permission management across all Onyx resources including agents, connectors, document sets,
and administrative functions.
RBAC enables user-level access controls for restrictive APIs and provides scalable access management for large
organizations.

### **Curator Role**

An intermediate role between basic users and administrators, designed for security-conscious organizations.
Curators can manage and curate content without requiring full admin privileges or access to sensitive credentials like
API keys.

This enables larger teams to delegate knowledge management tasks securely while maintaining operational flexibility and
security boundaries.

### **Extended Developer APIs**

Additional APIs for developers building custom integrations, RAG applications, and automated workflows.

**Available APIs:**
- Search-only endpoints
- Non-streaming completions
- Access control management
- Custom workflow integration

These APIs enable teams to build on Onyx as an open-source knowledge platform for AI agents and specialized business
applications.

Comprehensive query tracking and analytics to help administrators understand usage patterns and improve user experience.

**Capabilities:**
- Review and filter query history by feedback type

### **Usage Dashboards**

Real-time monitoring of system usage through comprehensive statistics and reporting dashboards.

**Insights Include:**

### **Configurable Usage Limits**

Flexible usage controls and data retention policies to manage costs and ensure fair resource allocation.

## Content & Curation Features

### **Standard Answers**

Define authoritative, pre-approved responses for frequently asked or critical questions using regex pattern matching.
Currently available for OnyxBot implementations.

Standard Answers improve user trust and efficiency by ensuring consistent,
accurate responses to important queries while reducing variability in critical communications.

Complete customization of the Onyx interface to match your organization's brand identity and user experience
requirements.

- Security hardening and compliance configuration
- Custom infrastructure requirements
- Professional installation and configuration

### **LLM Proxy Support**

Custom integration support for proprietary or specialized language models with unique authentication and API
requirements.

enhancing data privacy and compliance while maintaining full functionality.
