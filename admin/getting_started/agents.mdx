## Configuration Options

1. **Access Control**: Define who can access your agent
2. **Starter Messages**: Initial messages to guide user interaction
3. **Labels**: Add tags to your agent to help you organize and search for it
4. **Knowledge Options**: Define how the agent will use the Search Tool and your knowledge base
5. **Reminder Prompt**: An additional message to remind the agent of its purpose and limitations

## Writing Effective Instructions

Your Instructions set the overall context and behavior of your agent. Instructions often start with:

- The agent's role
- General behavioral guidelines  
- Any limitations or restrictions

Think of this like giving your agent its job description and purpose.

### Example

```
You are an HR assistant for Onyx Inc. You have access to the company's HR policies, benefits packages, and procedures. Maintain a professional and friendly tone in all interactions. If you're unsure about any information, advise the user to contact the HR department directly. Do not make up information or policies.
