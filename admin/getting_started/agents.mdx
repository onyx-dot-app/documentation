# Agent Management

Agents in Onyx are specialized AI agents that can be configured with custom knowledge bases, system prompts, and tools to serve specific roles within your organization.

## Creating Agents

### Basic Agent Setup
1. Navigate to **Admin Panel** â†’ **Agents**
2. Click **"Create New Agent"**
3. Configure the basic settings:
   - **Name**: Clear, descriptive name (e.g., "HR Policy Agent")
   - **Description**: What the agent helps with
   - **Visibility**: Public or private access

### System Prompts
The system prompt defines your agent's personality, expertise, and behavior:

```
You are an HR agent for Onyx Inc. You have access to the company's HR policies, benefits packages, and procedures. Maintain a professional and friendly tone in all interactions. If you're unsure about any information, direct users to contact HR directly rather than guessing.

Key responsibilities:
- Answer questions about company policies
- Explain benefits and compensation
- Guide employees through HR processes
- Escalate complex issues to human HR staff
```

## Agent Management Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Single Purpose**: Each agent should have a clear, focused role
- **Clear Boundaries**: Define what the agent can and cannot do
- **Appropriate Access**: Only provide access to necessary information
- **Regular Updates**: Keep knowledge bases and prompts current

### Example System Prompt Template
```
You are a [ROLE] agent for [ORGANIZATION]. 

Your expertise includes:
- [DOMAIN AREA 1]
- [DOMAIN AREA 2]
- [DOMAIN AREA 3]

Your responsibilities:
- [PRIMARY FUNCTION]
- [SECONDARY FUNCTION]
- [ESCALATION CRITERIA]

Guidelines:
- [TONE AND STYLE]
- [LIMITATIONS]
- [ESCALATION PROCEDURES]
```

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Usage Analytics
Track agent performance through:
- Conversation volume and frequency
- User satisfaction ratings
- Common question patterns
- Knowledge gap identification

### Continuous Improvement
- Review conversation logs for optimization opportunities
- Update system prompts based on user feedback
- Expand knowledge bases as needed
- Refine tool integrations

## Access Control

### User Groups
Assign agents to specific user groups:
- Department-based access (HR, Engineering, Sales)
- Role-based access (Managers, Individual Contributors)
- Project-based access (Temporary teams)

### Permission Management
Control agent capabilities:
- Read-only vs. action-enabled agents
- Sensitive information access
- External system integration permissions

Agents are powerful tools for scaling knowledge access and support within your organization. Proper configuration and management ensure they provide maximum value while maintaining security and accuracy.
