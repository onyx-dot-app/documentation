## How it works

The Google Cloud Storage connector pulls in all documents from the specified GCS bucket.
It supports various file formats including PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, and more.

Documents are updated every **1** day.

## Setting up

## Understanding Google Cloud Storage Structure

Google Cloud Storage organizes data into buckets. Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects (files).
You can think of a bucket as a root directory, and the objects as files within that directory.
