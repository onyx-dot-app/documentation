## Client Secret Authentication

Client secret authentication uses traditional Azure App Registration credentials to connect to SharePoint.
This method is suitable for most basic SharePoint integrations.

**Note:** Permission sync is not available with client secret authentication.
Use [certificate-based authentication](/archive/connectors/sharepoint/certificate)
if you need permission sync functionality.

## Setting up

### Step 1: Create Azure App Registration

More detailed instructions can be found following the video below.

1. Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) for your organization.
2. Navigate to "App registrations" using the search bar.
3. Click **New Registration**.
4. Name it something like "Onyx SharePoint Connector", leave everything else as default, and click **Register**.
5. Under "Essentials" in the overview tab, you will find the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.
   Save those for later.

### Step 2: Create Client Secret

1. Navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" tab in Azure Portal.
2. Click **New client secret**.
3. Fill out the description, set the expiration to 24 months, and click **Add**.
4. Copy the secret value in the **Value** column for later.

**Important:** Make sure to copy the secret value immediately as it won't be visible again.

### Step 3: Configure API Permissions

1. Navigate to the "API Permissions" tab in the Azure Portal.
2. Click **Add a permission**.
3. Click **Microsoft Graph**, then click on **Application permissions**.
4. Navigate to the "Sites" permission group.
5. Select the checkbox for **Sites.Read.All**.
    - *Advanced:* If you want to limit the sites this app has access to, select **Sites.Selected**. However,
      if you do this, you will need to add the App you are currently registering to each site you want to index.
6. Click **Add permissions**.
7. Finally, click **Grant admin consent for \<Organization name\>** (located next to **Add a permission**) and click **Confirm**.

### Step 4: Configure in Onyx

1. Navigate to the Onyx Admin Dashboard and select the **SharePoint** Connector.
2. Click **Create New** credential and select the **Client Secret** tab.
3. Provide the following information:
    - **Application (client) ID** from Step 1
    - **Directory (tenant) ID** from Step 1
    - **Client Secret Value** from Step 2
4. Click **Create** to save your credentials.

For permission sync capabilities,
consider using [certificate-based authentication](/archive/connectors/sharepoint/certificate).
