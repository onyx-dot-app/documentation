4. Once you have the API key, you can use it (as well as your domain) to authorize your Onyx connector. The [password field is unused when the API key is provided](https://developers.freshdesk.com/api/#authentication) and will be removed in a future version of Onyx. For now, please enter abc into the password field.

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard.
    2. In the sidebar select **Add Connector** and click on the **Freshdesk** tile.
    3. Select **Create New** and then provide your **Domain**, **Password** and **API Key**,
       along with an optional name for your credentials.
    4. Click **Create** and your credentials will be saved and automatically selected.
    5. After selecting **Continue** you can choose a name for your connector and then click **Create Connector**.
    6. Once you have created your connector Onyx will automatically begin indexing your tickets.
