## Effective Prompts for your Assistant

Your Instructions set the overall context and behavior of your assistant. Instructions often start with:

- The assistant's role
- General behavioral guidelines
- Any limitations or restrictions

Think of this like giving your assistant its job description and purpose.

Example:

```
You are an HR assistant for Onyx Inc. You have access to the company's HR policies, benefits packages, and procedures. Maintain a professional and friendly tone in all interactions. If you're unsure about any information, advise the user to contact the HR department directly. Do not make up information or policies.
```

Your Instructions can also direct how the assistant should handle and respond to user queries. It can define:

- Steps to follow for each query
- How to process and present information
- When to ask for clarification
- How to handle different types of requests

Think of this like giving your assistant a specific protocol for handling each interaction.

Example:

```
Follow these steps when responding to a user query:
1. Identify the main HR topic or policy in the user's question.
2. Search the provided HR documents for relevant information.
3. Summarize the applicable policy or procedure in clear, concise language.
4. If multiple policies apply, list them in order of relevance.
5. Provide the source document and section for your information.
6. If the query is unclear, ask the user for clarification before providing an answer.
7. If the query is outside your knowledge base, politely direct the user to contact the HR department.
```

## Testing and Refinement

After creating your assistant, make sure to:

1. Conduct test runs with various queries
2. Gather feedback from a small group of users
3. Use Onyx's analytics tools to identify areas for improvement
4. Regularly update and refine your assistant based on feedback and changing needs
