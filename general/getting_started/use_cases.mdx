## What Makes Onyx Different

Onyx is the AI Assistant connected to your organization's docs, apps, and people. Unlike generic AI systems that have no context of your team, Onyx enables new types of questions like "What is the most common feature request we've heard from customers this month" and delivers answers in seconds.

With connections to 40+ different tools, Onyx serves as your organization's knowledge hub, making all information instantly searchable and actionable.

## Common Getting Started Questions

### **Why are example documents connected to my Onyx deployment?**
This is just a demonstration of how connectors work. You can connect your own team's knowledge sources, and Onyx will keep all information up-to-date and synchronized with your connected applications.

### **Is my data secure when connected to Onyx?**
Absolutely! Onyx is built with data security as the highest priority. All document processing happens within your Onyx deployment. The only external communication is with your chosen LLM provider for generating responses.

### **What about document permissions and access control?**
Advanced permission inheritance features are available in Onyx Enterprise Edition, automatically syncing access permissions from connected sources. This ensures users only see information they're authorized to access.
