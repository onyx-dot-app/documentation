## Our Commitment to Open Source

At Onyx, we believe that the future of AI belongs in the hands of everyone, not locked away in corporate silos. That's why we've made the fundamental decision to build Onyx as an **open source platform** from the ground up.

## Why Open Source Matters

### **Transparency & Trust**
When your organization's most sensitive data is involved, you deserve to know exactly how it's being processed. Our open source approach means every line of code is available for inspection, audit, and verification. No black boxes, no hidden data collection, no mysterious algorithms.

### **Data Sovereignty** 
Your data stays where it belongs—with you. Unlike cloud-only AI services, Onyx can be deployed entirely within your infrastructure. You maintain complete control over your information, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific requirements.

### **Freedom from Vendor Lock-in**
Open source means freedom. You're never trapped by proprietary formats, limited by arbitrary usage restrictions, or held hostage by changing pricing models. If you need to modify Onyx for your specific requirements, you have the code and the rights to do so.

### **Community-Driven Innovation**
The best software is built by communities, not committees. Our open source model enables developers worldwide to contribute features, fix bugs, and innovate in ways that serve the entire ecosystem. This collective intelligence makes Onyx more robust and feature-rich than any single company could achieve alone.

## Our Open Source Principles

### **Truly Open**
- **Source Code**: Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx) under the MIT License
- **No Core vs. Enterprise Split**: All essential features remain open source
- **Transparent Roadmap**: Development priorities and decisions made in the open

### **Community First**
- **Welcoming to All**: From first-time contributors to enterprise developers
- **Collaborative Development**: Features and improvements driven by real user needs
- **Open Governance**: Major decisions discussed transparently with the community

### **Sustainable Growth**
- **Long-term Commitment**: Open source isn't just our launch strategy—it's our permanent philosophy  
- **Balanced Approach**: We offer commercial support and hosting while keeping the core platform free
- **Resource Investment**: We dedicate significant engineering resources to maintaining and improving the open source project

## Enterprise Edition vs Open Source

While Onyx's core platform remains fully open source, we also offer an Enterprise Edition with additional features designed for larger organizations and complex deployments.

### **Open Source Features**
*[Content to be added - core features available in the open source version]*

### **Enterprise Edition Features**  
*[Content to be added - premium features available only in Enterprise Edition]*

### **Our Philosophy on Feature Distribution**
*[Content to be added - explanation of how we decide what goes in open source vs Enterprise Edition]*

We believe in maintaining a clear and fair distinction between our open source offering and Enterprise Edition, ensuring that individual users and smaller organizations have access to a fully functional platform while providing additional value for enterprise customers who need advanced features and support.
