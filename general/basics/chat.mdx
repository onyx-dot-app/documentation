The chat interface is your primary way to interact with Onyx. Think of it as having a conversation with an incredibly knowledgeable colleague who has access to all your organization's information.

## How Chat Works

### **Natural Conversation**
Just type your questions in plain English. You don't need special commands or syntax - ask questions the same way you'd ask a coworker.

**Examples:**
- "What's our vacation policy?"
- "Can you summarize yesterday's team meeting?"
- "How do I submit an expense report?"

### **AI-Powered Responses**
Onyx uses advanced AI to understand your question, search through your organization's connected data, and provide comprehensive answers with source citations.

### **Follow-up Questions**
Continue the conversation naturally. Onyx remembers the context of your chat, so you can ask follow-up questions without repeating yourself.

## Getting Better Results

### **Be Specific**
The more specific your question, the better the answer:
- Instead of: "Tell me about the project"
- Try: "What are the current milestones for the marketing project?"

### **Ask for Different Formats**
Request information in the format that's most useful to you:
- "Give me a bullet point summary of..."
- "Create a table showing..."
- "List the steps to..."

### **Use Follow-ups**
Build on previous answers:
- "Can you elaborate on that second point?"
- "What are the alternatives?"
- "Who should I contact about this?"

## Understanding Responses

### **Source Citations**
Onyx always shows you where information came from. Click on citations to see the original documents, ensuring you can verify and dive deeper into any topic.

### **Confidence Indicators**
Pay attention to how confident Onyx is in its responses. If information is uncertain or limited, Onyx will let you know.

## Switching Agents

Use the agent selector to switch between different AI assistants:
- **General Assistant**: For broad questions across all your data
- **HR Assistant**: Specialized for policy and benefits questions  
- **Technical Assistant**: Focused on documentation and troubleshooting
- **Custom Agents**: Built by your team for specific use cases

Each agent has different knowledge bases and capabilities tailored to specific needs.

## Chat Tips

- **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with general questions and use follow-ups to get specific details
- **Ask for examples**: Request real examples when learning about processes or policies
- **Don't hesitate to rephrase**: If you don't get the answer you need, try asking the same question differently
- **Save useful information**: Bookmark or copy important responses for future reference
