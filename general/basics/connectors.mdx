## What are Connectors?

Connectors are what make Onyx powerful - they connect your AI assistant to all the knowledge in your organization. When you ask Onyx a question, it searches through the data sources that have been connected through these connectors.

## How Connectors Affect You

### **Access to Your Information**
Connectors determine what information Onyx can access to answer your questions. If your team's Slack channels are connected, you can ask about recent discussions. If your company's documentation is connected, you can get answers from internal guides.

### **Real-time Updates**  
Connected data sources are automatically synchronized, so Onyx always has access to the most recent information when answering your questions.

### **Respect for Permissions**
Connectors maintain your existing access permissions. You'll only see information that you already have access to in the original systems.

## Common Data Sources

Your administrators can connect Onyx to sources like:
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail
- **Documents**: Google Drive, SharePoint, Confluence, Notion  
- **Code**: GitHub, GitLab
- **Project Management**: Jira, Asana, Linear
- **And many more...**

## Finding Information

Not sure what data sources are available? You can:
- Check with your administrator about available connectors
- Look at source citations when Onyx answers questions - they'll show you which connected systems provided the information
- Request new data sources if you need access to information that isn't currently connected
