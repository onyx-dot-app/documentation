## Common Questions

### How do I search for information?

Simply type your question in the search bar or chat interface using natural language. Onyx will search across all connected data sources and provide relevant results with source citations.

### Why can't I find certain documents?

You can only access documents that you have permission to view in the original systems. If you think you should have access to something, contact your administrator about connector permissions.

### How do I use different AI agents?

Use the agent selector to switch between different AI assistants. Each agent may specialize in different topics or have access to specific knowledge bases.

### Can I save my conversations?

Yes, your chat conversations are automatically saved and can be accessed from your chat history.

### How do I get better search results?

- Be specific in your questions
- Use natural language 
- Try rephrasing if you don't get the right results
