  You can now configure Onyx to use OIDC or SAML for authentication in the Community Edition.

  ### Projects
  Projects allow users to upload, organize, and start chats with their private files in Onyx. Projects is a direct replacement of My Documents. 

  You can find Projects in the chat side panel. After configuring a Project, you can start a new chat session with your uploaded files. Notably, you can start any number of chat sessions from a Project. Files you've previously uploaded to My Documents should appear in Projects.
