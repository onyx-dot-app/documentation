  Today, we're excited to announce the release of Onyx v2.0.0! This release brings a brand new UI, Projects,
  and many other improvements.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### UI Refresh

  Onyx has a brand new UI with updated colors, components, and subtle changes to the layout.
  Check out this release video showcasing the new UI!

  ### Single-sign on (SSO) added to Community Edition

  SSO (via OIDC and SAML) is now available in the Community Edition of Onyx!

  All users can now configure basic authentication, Google OAuth,
  or SSO via identity providers like Okta and Azure EntraID.

  Read more about authentication options in our [deployment docs](/deployment/authentication/).
  Read more about our open source philosphy in our [Open Source
  Statement](/overview/miscellaneous/open_source_statement/).

  ### Projects

  Projects allow users to organize files and chats based on a specific context.
  You can think of this as a folder where you upload files, define project-level instructions,
  and work from the same starting point in every chat session.

  Projects is a direct replacement of My Documents, but with added functionality.
  Files you've previously uploaded to My Documents should appear in Projects.

  ### New Docker Compose File

  We've simplified the Docker Compose files to make it easier to deploy Onyx.

  Previously, you may have used `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, or `docker-compose.gpu-dev.yml`.
  These have been consolidated into a single `docker-compose.yml` file.

  With the new compose file, you can run `docker compose up -d` to start Onyx.

  <Note>
    If you've previously used the old compose files, you will need to add the `-p onyx-stack` flag.

    I.e. `docker compose -p onyx-stack up -d`.

    Additionally, you will need to migrate any changes you may have made to your compose file.
  </Note>

  ### Organization info and personalization

  We've found that questions posed to Onyx often require context on who you are, what you work on,
  and what your company does.
  It is difficult to infer this from search results alone because they are a narrow view into your context.

  To help with this,
  admins can now add information about their organization in the **Workspace Settings** tab of the Admin Panel.
  Additionally, users can add information about themselves in the User Settings page.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/basic_org_info.png" alt="Organization info configuration"/>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/basic_personalization.png" alt="User info configuration"/>

  This is a simple, but powerful first step in our organization and personalization features. In the future,
  Onyx will extract and save this information automatically.

  ### Curators can now create actions

  Due to popular demand, Curators and Global Curators can now create Actions via OpenAPI or MCP!

  Read more about Actions in our [admin docs](/admin/actions/overview/).

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/showcase_curator_actions.png" alt="Curators can now create actions"/>

  ### Search filters

  Source filters are back for the Internal Search Action!

  To filter the sources of your search results, click the Actions configuration button in the Input Bar,
  select the arrow next to Internal Search, and select the sources you want to include.

  ### Language and Embedding Models

  We've added support for [Claude 4.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5)
  and [Gemini Embedding 001](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-embedding-available-gemini-api/).

  Try them out by configuring Anthropic in the **LLM Configuration** page and Google Vertex AI on the **Search
  Settings** page of the Admin Panel.

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@Django149](https://github.com/Django149) added right-to-left language support for the chat interface!
  - [@nsklei](https://github.com/nsklei) added support for indexing Microsoft Teams attachments!
  - [@linkages](https://github.com/linkages) added generation of SHA256 hashes of documents for the Onyx File Store!
  - [@grafke](https://github.com/grafke) fixed a bug in GPT search timestamps!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Support for SSE (server-sent events) MCP servers

  Onyx now supports SSE (server-sent events) MCP servers.
  Configure either Streamable HTTP or SSE servers in the Admin Actions page.

  Read more about MCP in our [admin docs](/admin/actions/mcp/).

  ### Ollama Support

  You can now configure both locally-hosted and cloud-hosted models with Ollama.
  Read more about Ollama in our [admin docs](/admin/ai_models/ollama/).

  ### One Line Deployment Script

  We've added a [single line launch script](deployment/getting_started/quickstart) to make it easier to deploy Onyx.
  This script will check your system resources and requirements and guide you through the necessary steps to deploy
  Onyx.

  <Note>
    This script is intended for new users. For existing users,
    we recommend sticking with your existing deployment method.
  </Note>

  ### KEDA Autoscaling

  We've added support for KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) to Onyx.
  Kubernetes deployments may choose either HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) or KEDA for autoscaling.
