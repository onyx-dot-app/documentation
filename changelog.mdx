  ## v2.2.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.2.0 release notes! This release brings major improvements to the agent framework
  with faster responses and more consistent outputs, a completely redesigned onboarding experience,
  and significant UI performance enhancements.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### Complete Agent Framework Revamp

  We've completely rebuilt the agent framework that powers Onyx conversations.
  The new implementation moves away from LangGraph to the Agents SDK, resulting in a dramatically
  simplified flow that delivers more consistent outputs, faster response times, and better tool calling accuracy.

  This architectural change also reduces per-message token consumption,
  making your conversations more efficient and cost-effective.

  ### New Login UI and Onboarding Flow

  First-time users now experience a streamlined onboarding journey that guides them through
  personalizing their workspace, setting up their LLMs, and configuring actions like Web Search and Image Generation.

  ### UI Performance and Polish

  We've made extensive improvements across the UI for performance and visual consistency.

  For example, the Assistants navigation page has been completely refreshed with a cleaner layout and improved organization.

  ### LLM Usage Observability

  Onyx now supports integration with [Braintrust](https://usebraintrust.com) for comprehensive LLM observability.
  Monitor your costs, latency, token usage, and more to gain insights into your AI operations.

  Read more about setting up observability in our [deployment configuration docs](/deployment/configuration/configuration/).

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Confluence OAuth and Jira Fixes

  We've resolved issues with Confluence OAuth authentication and updated Jira integration
  to address deprecated API endpoints, ensuring reliable connectivity with your Atlassian tools.

  ### Enhanced Provider Support

  Onyx now has improved support for LLM providers like Ollama and OpenRouter,
  giving you more flexibility in choosing the models that work best for your use case.

<Update label="v2.1.0" description="October 28th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Bug Fixes"]}>

  ## v2.1.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.1.0 release notes! This is a minor update with new support for OAuth Actions,
  improvements to the developer experience, and a new FOSS repo.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### OAuth Actions

  Onyx now supports Actions that require OAuth authentication. With this new feature,
  Onyx can now invoke many more actions on your behalf.

  Admins can configure OAuth Actions via the OpenAPI tab of the Actions page.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.1.0/showcase_oauth_actions.png" alt="OAuth Actions configuration"/>

  ### Improved Code Rendering

  Code blocks in chat now render much more consistently across all languages with proper syntax highlighting.
  This makes it easier to read and understand code generated by Onyx.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.1.0/showcase_code_rendering.png" alt="Code rendering"/>

  ### Fully Open Source (FOSS) Repository

  We're excited to share a completely FOSS version of Onyx!
  All code is MIT licensed and Enterprise Edition code is removed.

  This FOSS repo should make it easier for developers to contribute, audit, and deploy Onyx without licensing concerns.

  We will continue to develop on the main `onyx-dot-app/onyx` repository,
  and `onyx-foss` will automatically sync new changes.

  Checkout the repo at this link: [onyx-foss](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx-foss).

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@camro](https://github.com/camro) fixed a tricky issue where the app was not redirecting to shared chats on login!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Name Personalization

  You can now set your name in the bottom left user icon! Just set your name in the User Settings modal.

  Your name and role are used to better personalize your conversations in Onyx.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.1.0/showcase_personal_name.png" alt="Name personalization"/>

  ### Theme Preference Persistence

  Your light mode/dark mode preference is now saved across browsers and sessions, even after cache clears.
  Set it once and forget about it!

  ### Image Size Reduction

  We've fixed a bug that was doubling the size of the model server Docker image.
  This reduces disk space requirements significantly for deployments (~26 GB needed for a fresh deployment).

<Update label="v2.0.0" description="October 20th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Deployment Changes", "Breaking Changes"]}>

  ## v2.0.0

  <Note>
    v2.0.0 has breaking changes.
    You may want to test the upgrade in a staging environment before deploying to production.
  </Note>

  Today, we're excited to announce the release of Onyx v2.0.0! This release brings a brand new UI, Projects,
  and many other improvements.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### UI Refresh

  Onyx has a brand new UI with updated colors, components, and subtle changes to the layout.
  Check out this release video showcasing the new UI!

  <div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden', borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}>
    <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FE_-6IjyyPw?si=arXXagEUvlgwMfv9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;
    web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0,
    left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem'}} />
  </div>

  ### Single-sign on (SSO) added to Community Edition

  SSO (via OIDC and SAML) is now available in the Community Edition of Onyx!

  All users can now configure basic authentication, Google OAuth,
  or SSO via identity providers like Okta and Azure EntraID.

  Read more about authentication options in our [deployment docs](/deployment/authentication/).
  Read more about our open source philosphy in our [Open Source
  Statement](/overview/miscellaneous/open_source_statement/).

  ### Projects

  Projects allow users to organize files and chats based on a specific context.
  You can think of this as a folder where you upload files, define project-level instructions,
  and work from the same starting point in every chat session.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0.0/showcase_projects.png" alt="Projects feature screenshot"/>

  Projects is a direct replacement of My Documents, but with added functionality.
  Files you've previously uploaded to My Documents should appear in Projects.

  ### New Docker Compose File

  We've simplified the Docker Compose files to make it easier to deploy Onyx.

  Previously, you may have used `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, or `docker-compose.gpu-dev.yml`.
  These have been consolidated into a single `docker-compose.yml` file.

  With the new compose file, you can run `docker compose up -d` to start Onyx.

  <Note>
    If you've previously used the old compose files, you will need to add the `-p onyx-stack` flag.

    I.e. `docker compose -p onyx-stack up -d`.

    Additionally, you will need to migrate any changes you may have made to your compose file.
  </Note>

  ### Organization info and personalization

  We've found that questions posed to Onyx often require context on who you are, what you work on,
  and what your company does.
  It is difficult to infer this from search results alone because they are a narrow view into your context.

  To help with this,
  admins can now add information about their organization in the **Workspace Settings** tab of the Admin Panel.
  Additionally, users can add information about themselves in the User Settings page.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0.0/basic_org_info.png" alt="Organization info configuration"/>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0.0/basic_personalization.png" alt="User info configuration"/>

  This is a simple, but powerful first step in our organization and personalization features. In the future,
  Onyx will extract and save this information automatically.

  ### Curators can now create actions

  Due to popular demand, Curators and Global Curators can now create Actions via OpenAPI or MCP!

  Read more about Actions in our [admin docs](/admin/actions/overview/).

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0.0/showcase_curator_actions.png" alt="Curators can now create actions"/>

  ### Search filters

  Source filters are back for the Internal Search Action!

  To filter the sources of your search results, click the Actions configuration button in the Input Bar,
  select the arrow next to Internal Search, and select the sources you want to include.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0.0/showcase_filters_1.png" alt="Actions in the Chat Input Bar"/>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0.0/showcase_filters_2.png" alt="Source filters"/>

  ### Language and Embedding Models

  We've added support for [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5),
  [Claude Haiku 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5),
  and [Gemini Embedding 001](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-embedding-available-gemini-api/).

  Try them out by configuring Anthropic in the **LLM Configuration** page and Google Vertex AI on the **Search
  Settings** page of the Admin Panel.

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@Django149](https://github.com/Django149) added right-to-left language support for the chat interface!
  - [@nsklei](https://github.com/nsklei) added support for indexing Microsoft Teams attachments!
  - [@linkages](https://github.com/linkages) added generation of SHA256 hashes of documents for the Onyx File Store!
  - [@grafke](https://github.com/grafke) fixed a bug in GPT search timestamps!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Support for SSE (server-sent events) MCP servers

  Onyx now supports SSE (server-sent events) MCP servers.
  Configure either Streamable HTTP or SSE servers in the Admin Actions page.

  Read more about MCP in our [admin docs](/admin/actions/mcp/).

  ### Permission Sync Status updates

  Permission sync connectors will now display sync status in the Admin Panel.

  ### Ollama Support

  You can now configure both locally-hosted and cloud-hosted models with Ollama.
  Read more about Ollama in our [admin docs](/admin/ai_models/ollama/).

  ### OpenRouter Support

  You can now configure Onyx to use models from OpenRouter.
  Read more about OpenRouter in our [admin docs](/admin/ai_models/openrouter/).

  ### One Line Deployment Script

  We've added a [single line launch script](deployment/getting_started/quickstart) to make it easier to deploy Onyx.
  This script will check your system resources and requirements and guide you through the necessary steps to deploy
  Onyx.

  <Note>
    This script is intended for new users. For existing users,
    we recommend sticking with your existing deployment method.
  </Note>

  ### KEDA Autoscaling

  We've added support for KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) to Onyx Helm charts.
  Kubernetes deployments may choose either HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) or KEDA for autoscaling.
