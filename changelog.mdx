<Update label="v2.7.0" description="January 7th, 2026" tags={["New Features", "Breaking Changes", "Bug Fixes"]}>

  ## v2.7.0

  A brand new Agent creation page, LLM configuration forms saw some love, and a new Image Generation page!

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  <Warning>
    v2.7.0 introduces [a new API](/developers/guides/chat_new_guide) for sending messages to Onyx.

    The old `/chat/send-message` and `/chat/send-message-simple-api` endpoints will be removed by Feb 1st, 2026.
  </Warning>

  ## Key Improvements

  ### Agent Creation

  The Agent creation page received a makeover!

  The form is now simpler, more intuitive, and matches the (sleek and beautiful)
  design of the rest of the Onyx interface.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.7/showcase_agent_creation.png" alt="Agent Creation Page"/>

  ### Image Generation Configuration

  Gone are the days of setting environemnt variables for image generation.
  There's a new page for configuring image generation models in the Admin Panel.

  You can re-use your existing OpenAI API key or setup new OpenAI or Azure providers.
  Nano Banana support is coming soon!

  <Info>
    If you've previously set up an image generation model via environment variables,
    you will need to create a new configuration via the Admin Panel to continue generating images.
  </Info>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.7/showcase_image_generation_configuration.png" alt="Image Generation Configuration Page"/>

  ### New LLM Configuration Forms

  The LLM configuration form also received a refresh in this release.

  If you're using OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex/Gemini, or OpenRouter,
  you can now set the providers to "auto-update" and display the latest, most recommended models.

  <Note>
    The auto-update feature requires an internet connection to GitHub to fetch our recommended models list.
  </Note>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.7/showcase_llm_configuration_forms.png" alt="LLM Configuration Forms"/>

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### MCP Server Deployment

  The Onyx MCP Server is now disabled by default in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  You will no longer see the container start and stop (when disabled) in Docker.

  To deploy the MCP Server,
  you will need to set `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=true` in your environment and uncomment the MCP Server section in your
  `docker-compose.yml` file.

  ### Model Server Changes

  Multiple custom models were removed from the model server image. As a result,
  Onyx's total disk and memory footprint was reduced!

  ### New Cloud Usage Limits

  We've recently seen a wave of abuse of our Cloud service's free LLM access. Moving forward,
  if you use our provided LLM keys, you'll see a weekly limit on LLM usage cost.

  If you run into this limit, feel free to reach out to us at hello@onyx.app, and we'll be happy to help!

  <Tip>
    These changes only apply if you use Onyx-provided LLM keys on [Onyx
    Cloud](https://cloud.onyx.app?utm_source=docs&utm_content=changelog).
  </Tip>
</Update>

<Update label="v2.6.0" description="December 30th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Bug Fixes", "Performance"]}>

  ## v2.6.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.6.0 release notes!

  This is one of our **largest releases to date**, and it includes a completely rebuilt chat experience,
  the Onyx Desktop App and MCP Server,
  and smarter model management that brings you the latest models from your providers without additional effort.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  <Note>
    **Known issue in v2.6.0:** During an embedding model swap,
    you will not be able to search your knowledge base until the swap is complete.
    This functionality will be restored in the next major release.
  </Note>

  ## Key Improvements

  ### Chat Experience Revamped

  In v2.0.0, we overhauled the visual design of Onyx. In this release,
  we've dug into the chat internals to make it more powerful, work with more models,
  and ultimately deliver the best LLM experience possible.

  To do this, we've built custom architecture for managing conversations and context, introduced parallel tool calling,
  and added the ability to invoke agents as tools in the chat.

  The result is an AI chat experience where your agent can find information from your knowledge base and the internet,
  keep only the most relevant information in context, call tools precisely when needed,
  and answer your questions quickly and accurately.

  Our Deep Research mode makes use of all of these new features. Try it out and let us know what you think!

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.6/showcase_new_chat_flow.png" alt="Deep Research with new chat capabilities"/>

  ### Dynamic Model management

  No more redeploying to access new models. Onyx now fetches model information dynamically with richer metadata,
  which means:

  - New models are automatically retrieved and work out of the box, including vision-capable models
  - Deprecated models are automatically hidden from your interface
  - When max tokens can't be detected, we now fall back to 32k instead of the previous 4k limit

  Note that admins will still need to make new models visible for end users via the LLM configuration page.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.6/showcase_dynamic_model_management.png" alt="Dynamic model management"/>

  ### Onyx MCP Server

  Bring Onyx directly into your development workflow with our new MCP server!

  Connect Onyx to Claude Code, your terminal, or any MCP-compatible client.
  Authenticate with your PAT or API key and access your document index and web search capabilities without leaving your
  tools.

  Upcoming features include OAuth authentication and uploading and managing files.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.6/showcase_onyx_mcp_server.png" alt="Onyx MCP Server"/>

  ### Onyx Desktop App (Preview)

  We're developing a native desktop application! The Onyx desktop app will be available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  If you would like to try it out,
  you can download the app from the [v2.6.0 release
  page](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/releases/tag/v2.6.0#:~:text=21%20other%20contributors-,Assets,-10).

  Through the desktop app, you can access Onyx Cloud or your self-hosted instance.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.6/showcase_onyx_desktop_app.png" alt="Onyx Desktop App"/>

  <Warning>
    The Onyx desktop app is currently published as a development/preview build.
    Please be aware that there may be bugs and issues.
    Documentation will be available when the app is officially published.

<Update label="v2.5.0" description="November 25th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Bug Fixes", "Performance"]}>

  ## v2.5.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.5.0 release notes! This update introduces code interpreter, new web search providers,
  and various improvements across the platform.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### Web Search Enhancements

  We've officially released support for new web search providers including Google PSE, Serper, Firecrawl,
  and a built-in Onyx web scraper!

  Configure these providers via the Web Search page in the Admin Panel and give your agents the ability to search the
  internet for real-time information and current events.

  New APIs for web search are also available for developers. Detailed setup and API reference docs will be coming soon!

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.5/showcase_additional_web_search.png" alt="Web Search Providers"/>

  ### Claude Opus 4.5 Support

  Onyx now supports Anthropic's newest, most powerful model: Claude Opus 4.5!
  Configure Claude Opus 4.5 via the LLM Configuration page in the Admin Panel.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.5/showcase_45_opus.png" alt="Claude Opus 4.5"/>

  ### Code Interpreter (Alpha)

  Onyx's Code Interpreter is now in alpha!
  This feature allows your agents to write and execute Python code to solve complex problems, perform data analysis,
  and generate visualizations.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.5/showcase_code_interpreter_alpha.png" alt="Code Interpreter Alpha"/>

  We built the code interpreter, in-house, to work with any model provider and LLM. It's a secure,
  FastAPI-based service that uses isolated Docker containers with strict resource limits, timeout controls,
  and file handling capabilities for security and reliability.

  Code interpreter is designed to work with any AI agent, not just Onyx. It's available as a standalone,
  fully open source project:
  [onyx-dot-app/code-interpreter](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/code-interpreter?utm_source=docs&utm_content=changelog).
  While Python is the first supported language, all common languages will be supported in the future.

  <Note>
    Code Interpreter is not yet ready for production use. If you enable the feature flag, you may encounter bugs!
    Please bear with us as we continue to develop and improve this feature.
  </Note>

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@sashank-rayapudi-ai](https://github.com/sashank-rayapudi-ai) added a new connector for Testrail!
  - [@mristau-alltrails](https://github.com/mristau-alltrails) identified and resolved a vulnerability in our nginx configuration!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Default Assistant MCP Tools

  The Default Assistant can now have MCP tools attached,
  making it easier to extend the default experience with custom actions and integrations.

  ### Document Search APIs in Community Edition

  Document search APIs have been moved from Enterprise Edition to Community Edition,
  giving all users access to programmatic document search capabilities.

  ### Auto-Pause for Failing Connectors

  Connectors that continuously fail will now automatically be paused. This helps relieve pressure on the background,
  API, and indexing containers, improving overall system stability.

  ### Kubernetes Affinity and Tolerations

  We've added affinity and tolerations to the Helm deployment templates,
  allowing you to customize where pods are scheduled in your Kubernetes environment.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.4.0" description="November 18th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Performance", "Bug Fixes"]}>

  ## v2.4.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.4.0 release notes!
  This release introduces powerful new controls for the Slack Federated connector, fine-grained LLM access controls,
  and various other improvements and bug fixes across the platform.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### Advanced Filtering for Slack Federated Connector

  The Slack Federated connector now supports comprehensive, entity-based filtering,
  which gives you precise control over the data available to Onyx users.

  Configure filters such as:
  - Channel selection with glob patterns
  - Message type filtering (1:1 DMs, group DMs, private channels)
  - Date extraction

  <Note>
    If you have an existing Slack Federated Connector,
    you will need to update the app's scopes to use the expanded search functionality (e.g. searching group DMs).

    Additionally,
    each user will need to revoke and re-authorize their OAuth access to the app for the new scopes to take effect.

    See the [Slack Federated Connector](/admins/connectors/official/slack/slack_federated/)
    app manifest documentation for more details.
  </Note>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.4/showcase_slack_federated_scoped_search.png" alt="Slack connector filtering options"/>

  ### LLM Access Controls

  Admins can now configure fine-grained access controls for LLM providers.

  This feature allows you to restrict which users or groups can access specific language models.
  Use access controls to better manage and monitor generative AI usage across your organization.

  Read more about LLM access controls in our [admin docs](/admins/advanced_configs/llm_access_controls/).

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.4/showcase_llm_rbac.png" alt="LLM access controls"/>

  ### Disable Default Assistant

  You now have the flexibility to disable the default assistant in your Onyx workspace.
  This is particularly useful for organizations with many custom assistants, each with specific configurations, tools,
  and instructions.

  To disable the Default Assistant,
  go to the **Workspace Settings** page and toggle the **Disable Default Assistant** switch.

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@sktbcpraha](https://github.com/sktbcpraha) fixed an issue where the Default Assistant was overriding legacy custom agent prompts!
  - [@alex000kim](https://github.com/alex000kim) fixed a tricky issue with special characters in the Teams connector!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Share Chat Button

  We've made sharing chats easier with a dedicated share button in the top right of the chat interface.

  ### Paginated Document Search API

  The document search API now supports pagination for more efficient retrieval of large result sets.

  ### Projects Token Limits

  We've increased the per-file token limit for Projects to 100k. Additionally,
  you can configure this limit with the `SKIP_USERFILE_THRESHOLD` environment variable.

  ### SSO User Provisioning Improvements

  Previously, inviting users to join your Onyx workspace would prevent non-invited users from automatically registering.

  Now, SSO-enabled workspaces can have both invited users and JIT-provisioned users!

<Update label="v2.3.0" description="November 11th, 2025" tags={["Performance", "New Features", "Bug Fixes"]}>

  ## v2.3.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.3.0 release notes!
  This release brings performance improvements that make Onyx feel significantly faster and more responsive,
  personal access tokens, expanded LLM provider support, and more.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### Personal Access Tokens

  Onyx now supports Personal Access Tokens for API authentication. This feature allows all users to have a secure,
  programmatic way to interact with Onyx via the API,
  making it easier to integrate Onyx into your workflows and automation tools.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.3/showcase_personal_access_tokens.png" alt="Personal Access Tokens"/>

  ### Massive Frontend Performance Improvements

  We've made extensive performance optimizations across the frontend that deliver a noticeably faster and more
  responsive experience.

  - Typing in the input bar is now lag-free, even during heavy operations.
  - UI updates are significantly faster with improved reactive performance,
  making interactions feel instant and smooth throughout the application.
  - First content load is also much faster with optimizations in data loading.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.3/showcase_frontend_performance.png" alt="Frontend Performance Improvements"/>

  ### Expanded LLM Provider Support

  We've added support for OpenAI image generation models via Azure,
  bringing more flexibility to your image generation capabilities.

  Additionally, Onyx now supports AWS GovCloud regions for Bedrock.

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### White Labeling Fixes

  We've resolved several issues with white labeling to ensure your custom branding displays correctly across all areas
  of the application.

  ### More Resilient Gmail Connector

  The Gmail connector now uses checkpointing for more resilient indexing.
  This makes the connector more reliable and significantly cheaper to run,
  especially when re-embedding your entire Gmail history.

  ### Air-Gapped Deployment Support

  We've fixed air-gapped deployments by packaging the tokenizer directly with the model server image.
  This ensures Onyx can run in completely isolated environments without requiring external dependencies.

  ### Optimized LLM Interactions

  We've simplified both system prompts and tool prompts,
  resulting in lower token consumption per interaction and more efficient tool calling.
  This reduces your LLM costs while maintaining the same quality of responses.

<Update label="v2.2.0" description="November 5th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Performance", "Bug Fixes"]}>

  ## v2.2.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.2.0 release notes!
  This release brings major improvements to the agent framework with faster responses and more consistent outputs,
  a completely redesigned onboarding experience, and significant UI performance enhancements.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### Complete Agent Framework Revamp

  We've completely rebuilt the agent framework that powers Onyx conversations.
  The new implementation moves away from LangGraph to the Agents SDK,
  resulting in a dramatically simplified flow that delivers more consistent outputs, faster response times,
  and better tool calling accuracy.

  This architectural change also reduces per-message token consumption,
  making your conversations more efficient and cost-effective.

  ### New Login UI and Onboarding Flow

  First-time users now experience a streamlined onboarding journey that guides them through personalizing their
  workspace, setting up their LLMs, and configuring actions like Web Search and Image Generation.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.2/showcase_onboarding.png" alt="Onboarding flow"/>

  ### UI Performance and Polish

  We've made extensive improvements across the UI for performance and visual consistency.

  For example,
  the Assistants navigation page has been completely refreshed with a cleaner layout and improved organization.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.2/showcase_agents_navigation.png" alt="Agents navigation"/>

  ### LLM Usage Observability

  Onyx now supports integration with [Braintrust](https://usebraintrust.com) or [LangFuse](https://www.langfuse.com)
  for comprehensive LLM observability. Monitor your costs, latency, token usage,
  and more to gain insights into your AI operations.

  Read more about setting up observability in our [deployment configuration
  docs](/deployment/configuration/configuration/).

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.2/showcase_braintrust.png" alt="LLM usage observability"/>

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@dafeliton](https://github.com/dafeliton) fixed an elusive bug with the web connector not parsing PDF URLs correctly and crashing!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Confluence OAuth and Jira Fixes

  We've resolved issues with Confluence OAuth authentication and updated Jira integration to address deprecated API
  endpoints, ensuring reliable connectivity with your Atlassian tools.

  ### Enhanced Provider Support

  Onyx now has improved support for LLM providers like Ollama and OpenRouter,
  giving you more flexibility in choosing the models that work best for your use case.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.1.0" description="October 28th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Bug Fixes"]}>

  ## v2.1.0

  Welcome to the Onyx v2.1.0 release notes! This is a minor update with new support for OAuth Actions,
  improvements to the developer experience, and a new FOSS repo.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### OAuth Actions

  Onyx now supports Actions that require OAuth authentication. With this new feature,
  Onyx can now invoke many more actions on your behalf.

  Admins can configure OAuth Actions via the OpenAPI tab of the Actions page.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.1/showcase_oauth_actions.png" alt="OAuth Actions configuration"/>

  ### Improved Code Rendering

  Code blocks in chat now render much more consistently across all languages with proper syntax highlighting.
  This makes it easier to read and understand code generated by Onyx.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.1/showcase_code_rendering.png" alt="Code rendering"/>

  ### Fully Open Source (FOSS) Repository

  We're excited to share a completely FOSS version of Onyx!
  All code is MIT licensed and Enterprise Edition code is removed.

  This FOSS repo should make it easier for developers to contribute, audit, and deploy Onyx without licensing concerns.

  We will continue to develop on the main `onyx-dot-app/onyx` repository,
  and `onyx-foss` will automatically sync new changes.

  Check out the repo at this link:
  [onyx-foss](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx-foss?utm_source=docs&utm_content=changelog).

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@camro](https://github.com/camro) fixed a tricky issue where the app was not redirecting to shared chats on login!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Name Personalization

  You can now set your name in the bottom left user icon! Just set your name in the User Settings modal.

  Your name and role are used to better personalize your conversations in Onyx.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.1/showcase_personal_name.png" alt="Name personalization"/>

  ### Theme Preference Persistence

  Your light mode/dark mode preference is now saved across browsers and sessions, even after cache clears.
  Set it once and forget about it!

  ### Image Size Reduction

  We've fixed a bug that was doubling the size of the model server Docker image.
  This reduces disk space requirements significantly for deployments (~26 GB needed for a fresh deployment).

<Update label="v2.0.0" description="October 20th, 2025" tags={["New Features", "Deployment Changes", "Breaking Changes"]}>

  ## v2.0.0

  <Note>
    v2.0.0 has breaking changes.
    You may want to test the upgrade in a staging environment before deploying to production.
  </Note>

  Today, we're excited to announce the release of Onyx v2.0.0! This release brings a brand new UI, Projects,
  and many other improvements.

  Thank you to our contributors for helping make this release possible!

  ## Key Improvements

  ### UI Refresh

  Onyx has a brand new UI with updated colors, components, and subtle changes to the layout.
  Check out this release video showcasing the new UI!

  <div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden', borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}>
    <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FE_-6IjyyPw?si=arXXagEUvlgwMfv9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;
    web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0,
    left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem'}} />
  </div>

  ### Single-sign on (SSO) added to Community Edition

  SSO (via OIDC and SAML) is now available in the Community Edition of Onyx!

  All users can now configure basic authentication, Google OAuth,
  or SSO via identity providers like Okta and Azure EntraID.

  Read more about authentication options in our [deployment docs](/deployment/authentication/).
  Read more about our open source philosophy in our [Open Source
  Statement](/overview/miscellaneous/open_source_statement/).

  ### Projects

  Projects allow users to organize files and chats based on a specific context.
  You can think of this as a folder where you upload files, define project-level instructions,
  and work from the same starting point in every chat session.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0/showcase_projects.png" alt="Projects feature screenshot"/>

  Projects is a direct replacement of My Documents, but with added functionality.
  Files you've previously uploaded to My Documents should appear in Projects.

  ### New Docker Compose File

  We've simplified the Docker Compose files to make it easier to deploy Onyx.

  Previously, you may have used `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, or `docker-compose.gpu-dev.yml`.
  These have been consolidated into a single `docker-compose.yml` file.

  With the new compose file, you can run `docker compose up -d` to start Onyx.

  <Note>
    If you've previously used the old compose files, you will need to add the `-p onyx-stack` flag.

    I.e. `docker compose -p onyx-stack up -d`.

    Additionally, you will need to migrate any changes you may have made to your compose file.
  </Note>

  ### Organization info and personalization

  We've found that questions posed to Onyx often require context on who you are, what you work on,
  and what your company does.
  It is difficult to infer this from search results alone because they are a narrow view into your context.

  To help with this,
  admins can now add information about their organization in the **Workspace Settings** tab of the Admin Panel.
  Additionally, users can add information about themselves in the User Settings page.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0/basic_org_info.png" alt="Organization info configuration"/>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0/basic_personalization.png" alt="User info configuration"/>

  This is a simple, but powerful first step in our organization and personalization features. In the future,
  Onyx will extract and save this information automatically.

  ### Curators can now create actions

  Due to popular demand, Curators and Global Curators can now create Actions via OpenAPI or MCP!

  Read more about Actions in our [admin docs](/admins/actions/overview/).

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0/showcase_curator_actions.png" alt="Curators can now create actions"/>

  ### Search filters

  Source filters are back for the Internal Search Action!

  To filter the sources of your search results, click the Actions configuration button in the Input Bar,
  select the arrow next to Internal Search, and select the sources you want to include.

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0/showcase_filters_1.png" alt="Actions in the Chat Input Bar"/>

  <img className="rounded-image" src="/assets/changelog/v2.0/showcase_filters_2.png" alt="Source filters"/>

  ### Language and Embedding Models

  We've added support for [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5),
  [Claude Haiku 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5),
  and [Gemini Embedding 001](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-embedding-available-gemini-api/).

  Try them out by configuring Anthropic in the **LLM Configuration** page and Google Vertex AI on the **Search
  Settings** page of the Admin Panel.

  ## Contributor Highlights

  - [@Django149](https://github.com/Django149) added right-to-left language support for the chat interface!
  - [@nsklei](https://github.com/nsklei) added support for indexing Microsoft Teams attachments!
  - [@linkages](https://github.com/linkages) added generation of SHA256 hashes of documents for the Onyx File Store!
  - [@grafke](https://github.com/grafke) fixed a bug in GPT search timestamps!

  ## Additional Improvements

  ### Support for SSE (server-sent events) MCP servers

  Onyx now supports SSE (server-sent events) MCP servers.
  Configure either Streamable HTTP or SSE servers in the Admin Actions page.

  Read more about MCP in our [admin docs](/admins/actions/mcp/).

  ### Permission Sync Status updates

  Permission sync connectors will now display sync status in the Admin Panel.

  ### Ollama Support

  You can now configure both locally-hosted and cloud-hosted models with Ollama.
  Read more about Ollama in our [admin docs](/admins/ai_models/ollama/).

  ### OpenRouter Support

  You can now configure Onyx to use models from OpenRouter.
  Read more about OpenRouter in our [admin docs](/admins/ai_models/openrouter/).

  ### One Line Deployment Script

  We've added a [single line launch script](deployment/getting_started/quickstart) to make it easier to deploy Onyx.
  This script will check your system resources and requirements and guide you through the necessary steps to deploy
  Onyx.

  <Note>
    This script is intended for new users. For existing users,
    we recommend sticking with your existing deployment method.
  </Note>

  ### KEDA Autoscaling

  We've added support for KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) to Onyx Helm charts.
  Kubernetes deployments may choose either HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) or KEDA for autoscaling.
