## What is Onyx?

### Open Source AI Platform for Work

Think of Onyx as your go-to entry point to Generative AI at work. Onyx provides a natural language chat interface to team-approved LLMs and is aware of all of your team's internal knowledge. 

Create AI Agents connected to your team's applications and share them with teammates. Onyx processes all your data locally (within the deployment) and respects the permissions of the user for searches, AI responses, and Actions taken in external apps.

## Differentiation

How is Onyx different from something like a Glean or ChatGPT Enterprise?

### **Open Source**
Onyx is made for security, data privacy, and ease of self-hosting. It's easy and free to [get started](/general/getting_started/quickstart). For teams investing in a long-term GenAI strategy, it also means Onyx is easy to extend or customize to your team's specific needs.

### **Reliable Responses** 
Onyx builds a document/people index behind the scenes using LLM native techniques which allows it to give more relevant results - for example contextual retrieval, advanced RAG, Hybrid Search, and LLM generated knowledge graphs.

### **Highly Configurable**
Onyx is designed with flexibility in mind so you can optimize the experience for your team. Bring any LLM model, connect up exactly what you want, and enable the features you need.
