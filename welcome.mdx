## What is Onyx?

<Warning>
  Revise this for clarity and concision
</Warning>

Onyx is your team's entry point to Generative AI.
Onyx provides a natural language interface to all of your team's LLMs and can be connected with your team's knowledge
and applications. Build custom AI Agents, search through documents, research the web, and more.

<Tip>
  Whether it's a local deployment or Onyx Cloud, your data remains private and is never used to train models.
