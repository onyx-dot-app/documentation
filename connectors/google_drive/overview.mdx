## How it works

The Google Drive connector ingests your drive documents. It syncs the latest information from
your Google Drive every 10 minutes. - Currently supports Google Docs, Sheets, and PDF files.

## Setting up

Note: This Connector is relatively involved to set up.

- **[Recommended]** If you want to setup the connector via Service Accounts, follow the guide [here](/connectors/google_drive/service_account).
  This does require a business Google Workspace / access to the Admin panel. If you are an organization that meets
  these pre-requisites, then this is likely the preferred approach.

- If you want to setup the connector via individual account OAuth, follow the guide [here](/connectors/google_drive/oauth).
  This does not require a business Google Workspace.

- If you have any questions about the setup / which approach is best for you, don't hesitate to reach out
  to [founders@onyx.app](mailto:founders@onyx.app) OR `@Yuhong Sun` / `@Chris Weaver` in
  [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/onyx-dot-app/shared_invite/zt-34lu4m7xg-TsKGO6h8PDvR5W27zTdyhA) if you need help.
