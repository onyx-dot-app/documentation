## June 2025 Update

Slack has changed their Terms of Service, preventing users from indexing their data (source: [Slack](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/api)).
As a result, the only way to add Slack information into Onyx is by using the `search` APIs that Slack provides.

These APIs are significantly slower and lower quality than the previous index-based approach.

Your data is your data â€” if you care about higher quality Slack search then please talk to your customer success
representative and make it clear that this change reduces the value you get out of Slack.

If you have any questions, please reach out to founders@onyx.app or send us a message in Slack.

4. Select the "YAML" tab, paste the following manifest into the text box, and click **Next**:

```
display_information:
  name: Onyx Search Assistant
  description: Search your Slack data as yourself
  background_color: "#4A154B"
oauth_config:
  redirect_urls:
    - <YOUR_ONYX_DOMAIN>/federated/oauth/callback
  scopes:
    user:
      - channels:read
      - groups:read
      - im:read
      - mpim:read

      - channels:history
      - groups:history
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false

```

<Info>
For Onyx Cloud, the `redirect_urls` value should be `https://cloud.onyx.app/federated/oauth/callback`.
</Info>

<Warning>
  We do not currently support token rotation, so `token_rotation_enabled: false`
  is necessary.
</Warning>

5. Click the **Create** button.
6. In the app page, navigate to the **Basic Information** tab under the **Settings** header.
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **CLient Secret**. Store those somewhere safe for the next step.
