The Confluence connector pulls in all pages and comments from the specified spaces/pages once at the beginning and then pulls updates every 10 minutes.

## Setting up

### Authorization

    1. Follow the guide described [here](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Atlassian-Jira-Confluence-Authentication-Create-API-Token.htm) to get an access token.

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Confluence** Connector
    2. For your credentials, provide the **Access Token** and the **Username** (typically an email) it belongs to:
    3. For Confluence setup, you must provide:
       - **Wiki Base URL**: The base URL of your Confluence instance (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki)
       - **Whether you're using Confluence Cloud or Datacenter**: Check the `Is Cloud` box if you are using a Confluence Cloud instance, uncheck for Confluence Server/Data Center
    4. Then choose how you'd like this connector to index your Confluence instance:
        - Everything: 
            - If you select this option, the connector will index everything the provided credentials have access to.
        - Space: 
            - Input the key of the space you'd like to index (e.g., `KB`)
        - Page: 
            - Page ID: Specific page ID to index - leave empty to index the entire space (e.g., `131368` for a specific page)
            - Index Recursively: Check this box to index the specified page AND all of its children.
        - CQL Query: 
            - If you'd like finer control over what is indexed, you can use a CQL query. The query must contain 'type=page' and any lastmodified filters will be overwritten. See the [CQL documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/) for more information.

    5. Click the `Connect` button! All the specified spaces/pages and related comments will now be pulled into Onyx every **10** minutes.

#### Permission Syncing

If you are an enterprise customer connecting to Confluence Server/Data Center and you would like to enable permission syncing, the provided credentials must be from an admin user.
