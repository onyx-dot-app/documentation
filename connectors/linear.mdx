## How it works
The Linear connector pulls in all the Linear issues and the associated comments.

Issues are updated every **10** minutes.

## Setup

### Configure your Linear Application + Onyx env variables

<Info>
  This is only necessary if self-hosting Onyx. If using [Onyx
  Cloud](https://cloud.onyx.app), you can skip this step.
</Info>

    1. [Create a Linear Application.](https://linear.app/settings/api/applications/new) This step must be completed by an admin of the linear workspace you wish to connect to Onyx. The application callback urls should include `<your onyx host>/connector/oauth/callback/linear` For example, for a local deployment with default configurations one of the lines should be `http://localhost:3000/connector/oauth/callback/linear`
    2. Set the following environment variables on your Onyx instance using the Client ID and Signing Secret provided by Linear for your new app:

```bash
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

    3. Restart your Onyx instance as you normally would to apply the changes.

### Indexing

    1. In the Onyx UI, navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Linear** Connector
    2. Click the `Create New` button to go through the OAuth flow.
    3. Once you've authorized the application, you'll be redirected back to Onyx.
    4. Select the new credential and click Continue
    5. Enter connector name and permissions information
    6. Click `Create Connector` to begin indexing Linear issues and comments!
