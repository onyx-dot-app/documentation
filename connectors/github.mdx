## How it works

The Github Connector picks up all of the Pull Requests and Issues in a specified repository.

- It will index both Open and Closed PRs. This includes the Title and Summary.
- It will index Issues and comments both Open and Closed
- Includes certain other metadata such as the URL, creator, etc.

## Permission Sync Feature
The GitHub connector supports permission synchronization, which ensures that users can only access documents they have permissions to view in GitHub. When enabled, this feature:

- Syncs user permissions from GitHub repositories and organizations
- Ensures that users only see search results for repositories they have access to
- Maintains consistent access control between GitHub and Onyx

<Note>
Permission sync is available only on Cloud and the Enterprise Edition of Onyx, and it requires additional token permissions beyond those needed for basic indexing.
</Note>

<Info>
### ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Public Email Profile

**VERY IMPORTANT:** For permission sync to work, users must have their email address publicly visible in their GitHub profile. If a user's email is set to private, they will not get access to any documents through Onyx.

How to Make Your Email Public on GitHub:

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
3. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu
4. In the left sidebar, click on **Emails**
5. Scroll down to **Keep my email addresses private** and **uncheck this option**
6. Now go back to the left sidebar and click on **Public profile**
7. Scroll down to the **Public email** section
8. Select your email address from the dropdown
9. Click **Update profile** to save the changes

**Why is this required?** 

Onyx uses the public email to match GitHub users with Onyx users for permission synchronization. Without a public email, the system cannot identify which GitHub permissions apply to which Onyx user.

## Setting up

### Authorization

This Connector uses a GitHub Access Token. The required permissions depend on whether you're using the permission sync feature.

#### Basic Setup (Indexing Only)

For basic indexing without permission sync:

1. [This guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) shows the following steps in detail.
2. Log in to GitHub.
3. In the upper right corner, expand your profile and click on **Settings**
4. On the bottom, go to **Developer settings** -> **Personal access tokens** -> **Tokens (classic)**
5. Click on **Generate new token**
6. Grant the following permissions:
   - **Repository permissions:**
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories) - to access PRs and issues

#### Permission Sync Setup

For permission sync functionality, you need additional permissions:

**Repository permissions:**
- **Administration:** Read access
- **Issues:** Read access  
- **Metadata:** Read access
- **Pull requests:** Read access

**Organization permissions:**
- **Administration:** Read only
- **Members:** Read only

#### Token Configuration

1. Set any expiration time. A new token will have to be provided to Onyx to continue updating the Onyx index once this one expires.
2. **Important:** If you plan to use permission sync, ensure all the above permissions are granted when creating the token.

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **GitHub** Connector
    2. For [https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx), it would look like:
