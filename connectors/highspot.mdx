## How it works

The Highspot connector indexes documents from your Highspot instance. It can index either specific spots you add or all spots where you have view access and download permissions.

## Setting up

### Authorization

> **IMPORTANT:** Highspot Platform Plus is an add-on feature that provides access to the API. Without Platform Plus, users cannot access the API features required for this connector. Please ensure your organization has purchased the Platform Plus add-on before proceeding.

#### Enabling Developer Options

    1. Log into your Highspot account as an administrator
    2. Click on your profile icon in the top right corner and select "Settings" from the list
    3. On the new page that opens, select "your company" under company settings
    4. Navigate to "Access and Privacy" and click on "API Access"
    5. Add the user(s) who will need to generate API keys and secrets
    6. And also confirm you enabled the "API Access for Users"
