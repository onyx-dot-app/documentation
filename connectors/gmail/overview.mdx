## How it works

The Gmail connector ingests your mails. It syncs the latest information from
your Gmail every 10 minutes. - Currently supports plain text emails.

## Setting up

Note: This Connector is relatively involved to set up.

- If you want to setup the connector via individual account OAuth, follow the guide [here](/connectors/gmail/oauth).
  This does not require a business Google Workspace.

- If you want to setup the connector via a Service Account, follow the guide [here](/connectors/gmail/service_account).

- If you have any questions about the setup / which approach is best for you, don't hesitate to reach out
  to [founders@onyx.app](mailto:founders@onyx.app) OR `@Yuhong Sun` / `@Chris Weaver` in
  [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/onyx-dot-app/shared_invite/zt-34lu4m7xg-TsKGO6h8PDvR5W27zTdyhA) if you need help.
