title: OAuth Setup
---

This section walks through setting up the Gmail connector using a OAuth-enabled Google App.
Anyone can do this (even without a paid Google Workspace)!

If you're an organization with a Google Workspace, and you'd rather use a Service Account to access Gmail,
it will be available soon!

### Authorization

    1. Create a **Google Cloud Project**
        - [https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

    2. Enable the **Gmail API**
        - On the left panel, open **APIs & services**
        - Go to **Enabled APIs and services**
        - On the top click **+ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**
        - Search for **Gmail API** and click **ENABLE**
        - Alternatively visit this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=gmail.googleapis.com),
        select your project and enable the **Gmail API**

    3. Set up the OAuth consent screen
        - Under **APIs & services**, select the **OAuth consent screen** tab
        - If you don't have a **Google Organization** select **External** for **User Type**
        - Call the app Onyx (or whatever you want)
        - For the required emails, use any email of your choice or `founders@onyx.app`
        if you wish for the Onyx team to help handle issues.
        - Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**

    4. Set up Scopes
        - Add the scope `.../auth/gmail.readonly` for `Gmail API`
    
#### To enable permission syncing for this connector: 
    - Enable the **Admin SDK API**
        - visit this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=admin.googleapis.com),
        select your project and enable the **Admin SDK API**
    - Add the scope `.../auth/admin.directory.user.readonly` for `Admin SDK API`
    - Add the scope `.../auth/admin.directory.group.readonly` for `Admin SDK API`
    - The account performing the OAuth flow must have an Admin role in the Google Workspace that has access to the "Groups > Read" privilege.
        - This can be set by an admin in the admin panel of the Google Workspace under Account>Admin roles.
    - **Note**: If you are using a Google Workspace, you can also set up a Service Account to access Gmail. This is currently in development and will be available soon.

    5. Set up Test users
        - This is only applicable for users without a Google Organization.
            - Typically for a company, Onyx would be set up as an internal app so this step would not apply.
        - Add at least one test user email. Only the email accounts added here will be allowed to run the OAuth
        flow to index new emails.
        - Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**, review the changes and click **BACK TO DASHBOARD**

    6. Create Credentials
        - Go to the **Credentials** tab and select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** -> **OAuth client ID**

![GmailCredential](/images/connectors/google_drive/GoogleDriveCredential.png) 
    - Choose **Web application** and give it some name like `OnyxConnector` 
    - Add a **Authorized JavaScript origins** for `http://localhost:3000` (or `https://<INTERNAL_DEPLOYMENT_URL>` if you have setup Onyx for production use) 
    - Add a **Authorized redirect URIs** for `http://localhost:3000/admin/connectors/gmail/auth/callback` 
    (or `https://<INTERNAL_DEPLOYMENT_URL>/admin/connectors/gmail/auth/callback` if you have setup Onyx for production use)

        - Click create and on the right hand side next to **Client secret**, there is an option to download the
        credentials as a JSON. Download the JSON for use in the next step.
