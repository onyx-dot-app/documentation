title: IAM Role-Based Authorization
description: "Authorize the S3 connector using an AWS IAM Role with assume role policy."
---

### When to use this method

- When you need to segregate permissions, granting specific S3 access without modifying your EC2 instance's main role
- When you require temporary, frequently rotated credentials for S3 access, without managing long-lived access keys
- When working in multi-account AWS environments, enabling cross-account S3 access through role assumption

### Setting up the IAM Role

1. **Create the S3 Access Role:**
   - In AWS Console, go to **IAM › Roles** and click **Create role**
   - For **Trusted entity type**, select **Custom trust policy**
   - In the Custom trust policy JSON editor, configure who can assume this role. You can choose from:
     - **IAM Role**: `"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YourExistingEC2Role"`
     - **AWS Service**: `"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"` (for EC2 instances)
   
   Example for EC2 role (replace `YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `YourExistingEC2Role`):
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YourExistingEC2Role"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Click **Next**
   - Attach **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy or create a custom policy for specific buckets:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-source-bucket-name",
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-source-bucket-name/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Name it (e.g., `OnyxS3AccessRole`) and click **Create role**
   - Copy the **Role ARN** from the role summary page (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_CREATED_ROLE_NAME`)

2. **Grant Assume Role Permission to your EC2 Instance's Role:**
   - Go back to **IAM › Roles** and find your EC2 instance's existing role
   - Click on the role and go to the **Permissions** tab
   - Click **Add permissions › Create inline policy**
   - Switch to JSON and add this policy (replace with your actual account ID and role name):
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_CREATED_ROLE_NAME"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Name the policy (e.g., `AllowAssumeOnyxS3Role`) and click **Create policy**

Your EC2 instance now uses its existing instance profile to obtain temporary credentials for the OnyxS3AccessRole, which can then securely interact with your designated S3 buckets.

### Credential Entry in Onyx

When configuring the S3 connector in Onyx, you'll need to:
1. Click on the **IAM Role** tab
2. Enter the **Role ARN** you copied earlier (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_CREATED_ROLE_NAME`)

Once you have your IAM Role ARN, proceed to the [indexing steps in the overview](/connectors/s3/overview#indexing) to configure your S3 connector.
