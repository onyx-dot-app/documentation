## Installation Script

The install script requires `Bash` to run so it works out of the box for Linux and MacOS. To run Onyx on Windows,
install Bash or refer to the [Docker](/deployment/local/docker) deployment.

To deploy with a single command:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/main/deployment/docker_compose/install.sh > install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Alternatively, download and run the installation script below.

  Click here to download the install.sh script from GitHub.
</Card>

After downloading the script, run it with `bash ./install.sh`

The script will do the following:
- Check your system resources and requirements
- Pull the necessary deployment and configuration files
- Prompt the user for the version of Onyx to deploy and other basic information
- Pull the Onyx containers and start them in Docker

<Info>
  The script will create a directory called **onyx_data** and there will also be a README in there with additional
  information.
