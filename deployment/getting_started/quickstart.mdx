## Onyx CLI

<Tip>
  Ideal for first-time users testing Onyx!
</Tip>

The Onyx CLI is a lightweight tool that checks your system for requirements and then deploys Onyx. 
By default, the tool uses images from our Docker Hub, but it can be configured to build from source.

**This tool should not be used for production deployments at this time.**

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Requirements">
        - [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
        - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install Onyx CLI">
        The Onyx CLI is installed via pip and is automatically kept up to date.
        <Accordion title="Optional: Create a virtual environment">
            A virtual Python environment is useful for isolating dependencies and avoiding conflicts with other projects.
            <Note>
              If you create a virtual environment, you'll need to activate it before running `onyx` CLI commands.
            </Note>
          
            ```bash
            python3.11 -m venv ~/.onyx-venv   # create virtual environment
            source ~/.onyx-venv/bin/activate  # activate virtual environment
            ```
        </Accordion>
        ```bash
        pip install onyx-dot-app
        # or pip3 install onyx-dot-app
        ```
        <Accordion title="Useful Onyx CLI Commands">
          None exhaustive:
            ```bash
            onyx help     # see all commands
            onyx doctor   # pre-flight check system requirements
            onyx up       # start Onyx Docker stack
            onyx down     # stop Onyx Docker stack
            onyx clone    # clone the Onyx repo
            ```
        </Accordion>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Check System Requirements">
        If you see any errors or warnings, please double check the system requirements and the [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing).
        ```bash
        onyx doctor
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch Onyx">
        ```bash
        onyx up
        ```
        <Accordion title="Notes about this command">
          See [Onyx CLI README] LINK HERE for more details.
          - This command will launch `onyx-stack` using Docker Compose
          - Without any additional arguments, this command will:
            - Create an `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx` directory
            - Place deployment files in `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/`
            - Pull images from Docker Hub using:
              - `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate`
          - You may add a .env file to the `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/docker_compose/` directory to add or override environment variables
          - You may direct the command to use an existing `onyx` directory by passing the `--source` flag
        </Accordion>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Launch with Docker Compose

<Note>
  Useful if you want to extend the Onyx codebase or if you need close control over the deployment process.
</Note>

The standard method to launch Onyx is using Docker Compose. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Requirements">
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the Onyx repo">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the compose files">
    ```bash
    cd onyx/deployment/docker_compose
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Onyx">
    To pull images from Docker Hub:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
    ```

    To build images from source:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
    ```
    <Accordion title="Notes about this command">
      - These commands will launch `onyx-stack`
      - These commands are also used to redeploy Onyx if any .env variables are changed
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy with Kubernetes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Onyx Helm repository">
    ```bash
    helm repo add onyx https://onyx-dot-app.github.io/onyx/
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your Helm repos">
    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the repository">
    ```bash
    helm search repo onyx   # lists Onyx charts if repo is added
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
