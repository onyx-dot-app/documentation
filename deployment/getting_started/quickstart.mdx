For more details, our [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing) covers selecting Cloud instances, resourcing by container, and how to scale your Onyx deployment.

## Onyx CLI

<Tip>
  Onyx CLI is coming soon! Preview the CLI below.
</Tip>
  <Accordion title="Onyx CLI preview">

  The Onyx CLI is a lightweight tool that checks your system for requirements and then deploys Onyx. 
  By default, the tool uses images from our Docker Hub, but it can be configured to build from source.

  **This tool should not be used for production deployments at this time.**

  <Steps>
      <Step title="Install Requirements">
          - [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
          - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
          - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install Onyx CLI and Check System Requirements">
          The Onyx CLI is installed via pip and is automatically kept up to date.
          <Accordion title="Optional: Create a virtual environment">
              A virtual Python environment is useful for isolating dependencies and avoiding conflicts with other projects.
              <Note>
                If you create a virtual environment, you'll need to activate it before running `onyx` CLI commands.
              </Note>
            
              ```bash
              python3.11 -m venv ~/.onyx-venv   # create virtual environment
              source ~/.onyx-venv/bin/activate  # activate virtual environment
              ```
          </Accordion>
        
          ```bash
          pip install onyx-dot-app
          # or pip3 install onyx-dot-app
          onyx doctor
          ```
          
          If you see any errors or warnings, please double check the system requirements and the [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing).

          <Accordion title="Useful Onyx CLI Commands">
            None exhaustive:
              ```bash
              onyx help     # see all commands
              onyx doctor   # pre-flight check system requirements
              onyx up       # start Onyx Docker stack
              onyx down     # stop Onyx Docker stack
              onyx clone    # clone the Onyx repo
              ```
          </Accordion>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Launch Onyx">
          ```bash
          onyx up
          ```
          <Accordion title="Notes about this command">
            See [Onyx CLI README] LINK HERE for more details.
            - This command will launch `onyx-stack` using Docker Compose
            - Without any additional arguments, this command will:
              - Create an `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx` directory
              - Place deployment files in `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/`
              - Pull images from Docker Hub using:
                - `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate`
            - Copy the `env.prod.template` file in `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/docker_compose/` to `.env` to configure your deployment
            - You may direct the command to use an existing `onyx` directory by passing the `--source` flag
          </Accordion>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure your Deployment">
        Configure your deployment using a `.env` file.
        ```bash
        cd ~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/docker_compose
        cp env.prod.template .env
        ```

        You'll need to restart Onyx after changing any `.env` variables.
        ```bash
        onyx down
        onyx up
        ```
        Read more about [configuration](/deployment/configuration/configuration).

## Launch with Docker

<Note>
  Useful if you want to extend the Onyx codebase or if you need close control over the deployment process.
