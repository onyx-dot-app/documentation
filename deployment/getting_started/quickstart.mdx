## Requirements

- Git
- Docker with compose (docker version >= 1.13.0)

## Setup

<Warning>
  The most common source of issues is under-resourcing. Before beginning, check
  the system requirements in our [Resourcing Guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing).
</Warning>

Note: This is just one way to run Onyx. Onyx can also be run on Kubernetes, there are provided Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts in the [deployment](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/tree/main/deployment) directory.

1. Clone the [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx) repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git
```

2. Navigate to **onyx/deployment/docker_compose**
```bash
cd onyx/deployment/docker_compose
```

3. (Optional) configure Onyx

4. Bring up your docker engine and run:
   - To pull images from DockerHub and run Onyx:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
   ```
   - Alternatively, to build the containers from source and start Onyx, run:
    ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
   ```
   - This may take 15+ minutes depending on your internet speed.
   - Additionally, once the images have been pulled / built, the initial startup of the `api_server` may take some time.
     If you see `This site can't be reached` in your browser despite all containers being up and running,
     check the `api_server` logs and make sure you see `Application startup complete`.
   - If you see `Killed` in the logs, you may need to increase the amount of memory given to Docker.
     For recommendations, check the system requirements in our [Resourcing Guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing).

<Info>
These commands are also used to redeploy if any **.env** variables are updated
</Info>

5. Onyx will now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Generative AI API Key

**Note:** On the initial visit, Onyx will prompt for a GenAI API key.

<Info>
  For example, you can get an OpenAI API key at:
  [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
</Info>

Onyx relies on Generative AI models to provide parts of its functionality. You can choose any LLM provider from the admin panel or even self-host a local LLM for a truly airgapped deployment.

## Shutting Down

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack down
```

<Info>
  add `-v` at the end to additionally delete the volumes (containing users, indexed documents, etc.)
</Info>

## Next Steps

Once Onyx is running:
- Configure your first [connectors](/admin/getting_started/connectors) to import data
- Set up your [LLM provider](/admin/getting_started/genai_models) for AI capabilities  
- Create custom [agents](/admin/getting_started/agents) for your team's needs
