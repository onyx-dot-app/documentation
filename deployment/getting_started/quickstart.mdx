For more details, our [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing) covers selecting Cloud instances, resourcing by container, and how to scale your Onyx deployment.

## Onyx CLI

<Tip>
  Ideal for first-time users testing Onyx!
</Tip>

The Onyx CLI is a lightweight tool that checks your system for requirements and then deploys Onyx. 
By default, the tool uses images from our Docker Hub, but it can be configured to build from source.

**This tool should not be used for production deployments at this time.**

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Requirements">
        - [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
        - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install Onyx CLI and Check System Requirements">
        The Onyx CLI is installed via pip and is automatically kept up to date.
        <Accordion title="Optional: Create a virtual environment">
            A virtual Python environment is useful for isolating dependencies and avoiding conflicts with other projects.
            <Note>
              If you create a virtual environment, you'll need to activate it before running `onyx` CLI commands.
            </Note>
          
            ```bash
            python3.11 -m venv ~/.onyx-venv   # create virtual environment
            source ~/.onyx-venv/bin/activate  # activate virtual environment
            ```
        </Accordion>
      
        ```bash
        pip install onyx-dot-app
        # or pip3 install onyx-dot-app
        onyx doctor
        ```
        
        If you see any errors or warnings, please double check the system requirements and the [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing).

        <Accordion title="Useful Onyx CLI Commands">
          None exhaustive:
            ```bash
            onyx help     # see all commands
            onyx doctor   # pre-flight check system requirements
            onyx up       # start Onyx Docker stack
            onyx down     # stop Onyx Docker stack
            onyx clone    # clone the Onyx repo
            ```
        </Accordion>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch Onyx">
        ```bash
        onyx up
        ```
        <Accordion title="Notes about this command">
          See [Onyx CLI README] LINK HERE for more details.
          - This command will launch `onyx-stack` using Docker Compose
          - Without any additional arguments, this command will:
            - Create an `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx` directory
            - Place deployment files in `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/`
            - Pull images from Docker Hub using:
              - `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate`
          - Copy the `.env.template` file in `~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/docker_compose/` to `.env` to configure your deployment
          - You may direct the command to use an existing `onyx` directory by passing the `--source` flag
        </Accordion>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure your Deployment">
      Configure your deployment using a `.env` file.
      ```bash
      cd ~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/docker_compose
      cp .env.template .env
      ```

      You'll need to restart Onyx after changing any `.env` variables.
      ```bash
      onyx down
      onyx up
      ```
      Read more about [configuration](/deployment/configuration/env_vars).
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Launch with Docker Compose

<Note>
  Useful if you want to extend the Onyx codebase or if you need close control over the deployment process.
</Note>

The standard method to launch Onyx is using Docker Compose. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Requirements">
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the Onyx repo">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the compose files">
    ```bash
    cd onyx/deployment/docker_compose
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Onyx">
    To pull images from Docker Hub:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
    ```

    To build images from source:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Deployment">
    Configure your deployment using a `.env` file.
    ```bash
    cd ~/onyx-dot-app/onyx/deployment/docker_compose
    cp .env.template .env
    ```

    You'll need to restart Onyx after changing any `.env` variables.
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack down
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
    ```

    Read more about [configuration](/deployment/configuration/env_vars).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy with Kubernetes Helm Charts

<Tip> If you already run a Kubernetes cluster and want to manage Onyx alongside your other workloads.</Tip>

The Onyx Helm chart packages all the required services (API, web, PostgreSQL, Vespa, etc.) into a single deployment. By default, persistent volumes will be created for stateful services (e.g. PostgreSQL, Vespa).

<Steps> 
  <Step title="Add the Onyx Helm repository"> 
    ```bash 
    helm repo add onyx https://onyx-dot-app.github.io/onyx/ 
    helm repo update
    helm search repo onyx
    ```
  </Step> 

  <Step title="Install Onyx"> 
    Install into its own namespace (recommended): 
  
    ```bash 
    kubectl create namespace onyx 
    helm install onyx onyx/onyx -n onyx 
    ``` 
    
    This will pull the latest Onyx chart and deploy all dependencies. 
  </Step> 

  <Step title="Verify the installation"> 

    ```bash 
    helm list -n onyx 
    kubectl get pods -n onyx 
    ``` 

    Wait until all pods are in a `Running` state before accessing Onyx. 
  </Step> 

  <Step title="Access Onyx"> 
    By default, the chart exposes Onyx via a Kubernetes Service. For local testing, you can port-forward: 
  
    ```bash 
    kubectl -n onyx port-forward service/onyx-nginx 8080:80 
    ``` 

    Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). 

  </Step> 
</Steps>

See the [Helm chart README](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/tree/main/charts/onyx) for advanced options such as running as non-root and testing with Kind.
