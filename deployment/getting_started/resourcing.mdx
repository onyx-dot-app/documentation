## Local Deployment (Docker)

You can control the resources available to Docker in the **Resources** section of the Docker Desktop settings menu.

Old, unused Docker images take up sizeable disk space. To clean up unused images, run `docker system prune --all`.

## Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP, etc.)

For small to mid scale deployments, we recommend deploying Onyx to a single instance in your cloud provider of choice.

<Tip> 
  For most use cases a single reasonably sized instance is enough for excellent performance!
</Tip>

When evaluating your instance, follow the Preferred resources in the table above. 

| Provider | Recommended Instance Type |
| --- | --- |
| AWS | `m7g.xlarge` |
| GCP | `e2-standard-4` or `e2-standard-8` |
| Azure | `D4s_v3` |
| DigitalOcean | Meet the preferred resources in the table above |

<Accordion title="Vespa on older CPUs">
  **Vespa requires Haswell (2013) or later CPUs.**
  
  For older CPUs, use the `vespaengine/vespa-generic-intel-x86_64` image in your Docker Compose file. 
  This generic image is slower.
  
  For  more details, see [Vespa CPU Support](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/cpu-support.html).

## Container-Specific Resourcing

For more efficient scaling, you can dedicate resources to each Onyx container using Kubernetes or AWS EKS.

See the [Onyx Helm chart](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/blob/main/deployment/helm/charts/onyx/values.yaml) `values.yaml` for our default requests and limits.

| Component | CPU | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api_server` | 1 | 2 Gi |
| `background` | 2 | 8 Gi |
| `indexing_model_server` | 2 | 4 Gi |
| `inference_model_server` | 2 | 4 Gi |
| `postgres` | 2 | 2 Gi |
| `vespa` | >= 4 | >= 8 Gi |
| `nginx` | 250m (1/4) | 128 Mi |

<Info>
  The `vespa` recommendation is the bare minimum for a production deployment. 
  With 50GB of documents, we recommend at least 10 CPU, 20Gi Memory.
</Info>

All together, this comes out to a total available node size of at least ~14 CPU and ~30GB of Memory.

## How Resource Requirements Scale

The main driver of resource requirements is the number of indexed documents. 
This primarily affects the index component of Onyx (a [Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) vector database), which is responsible for storing the vectorized documents and handling search requests. 

<Note>
  Vespa's resource requirements scale linearly with the document count.
</Note>

Based on our experience with large scale deployments, in addition to the previously mentioned minimums, Vespa needs:
- ~3GB of memory for each additional 1GB of documents
- ~1 CPU for each additional 2GB of documents

These are our rough estimates. Other factors that may affect resource requirements include:
- The embedding model
- Whether you have quantization and dimensional reduction enabled

### Resourcing Example
For a deployment with 10GB of text content, your `index` component will need:
- CPU: 4 + 10 * 0.5 = 9 cores
- Memory: 4 + 10 * 3 = 34GB

If deploying in a single instance, this would be *in addition to* the base requirements.
Overall, that would take us to >= 13 CPU and >= 50GB of memory. 

Given these requirements, a `m7g.4xlarge` or a `c5.9xlarge` EC2 instance would be appropriate.

If deploying with Kubernetes or AWS EKS, this would give a per-component resource allocation of:

| Component | CPU | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api_server` | 1 | 2 Gi |
| `background` | 2 | 8 Gi |
| `indexing_model_server` | 2 | 4 Gi |
| `inference_model_server` | 2 | 4 Gi |
| `postgres` | 2 | 4 Gi |
| `vespa` | 10 | 34 Gi |

Total available node size: ~20 CPU and ~60GB of Memory.
