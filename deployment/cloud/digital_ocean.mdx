<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Droplet">
    Create a Droplet with the appropriate resources. For this guide,
    we will use a recommended configuration with Docker pre-installed.

    <Note>
      Read our [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing) for more details.
    </Note>

    - Give your Droplet a descriptive name like `onyx-prod`
    - Select a region close to your users
    - Select the `Docker` image from the *Marketplace* tab
    - Choose a Droplet size with at least 4 vCPUs and 16GB RAM
    - Configure storage following the Resourcing Guide
    - Add your SSH key for secure access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Droplet">
    Click **Create Droplet** and then view your Droplet details.

    <Tip>
      Save the **Public IP address** of the Droplet!

  <Step title="Install Onyx requirements">
    Since we selected the Docker Marketplace image, Docker and Docker Compose are already installed.

    We just need to install `git`:

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y git
        ```
