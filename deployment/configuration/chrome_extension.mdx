### Self-Hosting the Extension

For private distribution without the Chrome Web Store:

2. **Host the files**: Place the CRX and update manifest on your server  
3. **Configure clients**: Use Admin console or Group Policy to point to your hosted files

## Extension Management

### Update Policies

- **Enterprise deployments**: Chrome handles automatic updates every 5 hours
- **Version pinning**: Available for force-installed extensions, but avoid extended use due to security updates
- **Self-hosted updates**: Increment version in manifest.json and replace hosted files
