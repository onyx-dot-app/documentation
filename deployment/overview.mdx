## Hosting Options
<CardGroup cols={1}>
    <Card title="Self-Hosted Open Source" icon="code" href="#quickstart">
        Self-hosting our open source software gives you complete control over your deployment and data. 
        With open source Onyx, you get the full set of Onyx's core features, including Search, Chat, Deep Research, Agents, and Actions!
        <br />
        Best for individual users or small teams.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Self-Hosted Enterprise Edition" icon="code" href="#quickstart">
        Onyx Enterprise Edition adds features such as permission-synced Connectors, OIDC/SAML, User Groups, and RBACs.
        Since you can self-host Enterprise Edition, all of your data is private and you get to plug and play your own AI services.
        <br />
        Typically only needed for larger teams or organizations.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Managed Onyx Cloud" icon="cloud" href="https://cloud.onyx.app">
        Onyx Cloud is a fully managed service. Just sign up, and we'll handle the rest! Onyx Cloud runs on AWS and is SOC 2 Type 2 certified.
        <br />
        Best for teams and organizations that don't want to self-host, but want Enterprise Edition features.
