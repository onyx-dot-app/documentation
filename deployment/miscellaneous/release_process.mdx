This page explains Onyx's release process, versioning scheme, and how updates are delivered to different deployment channels.

## Release Channels

<Note>
  Onyx maintains multiple release channels to provide stable and development versions for different use cases.
</Note>

### GitHub

Our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/releases) publish images to Docker Hub. Onyx has two types of releases:
- **Latest stable version** - Production-ready releases
- **Pre-release version** - Beta releases for testing

The `main` branch of the [Onyx repository](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx) is our development branch. 

<Warning>
  Although we try to keep `main` stable through CI/CD tests and code reviews, we do not recommend using `main` in production environments.
</Warning>

### Docker Hub

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/onyxdotapp/onyx) hosts the actual container images. 
New images are published every night from the `main` branch and when a new release is cut.

To identify the latest images programmatically, use our API endpoint:

```
https://cloud.onyx.app/api/versions
```

This endpoint returns the current latest stable and beta versions available on Docker Hub.

<Tip>
  If you don't specify a version when deploying Onyx, you will get the latest nightly builds.
</Tip>


## Versioning Scheme

Onyx follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) with a clear, predictable format.

**Standard Version Format:**
```
major.minor.hotfix
```

**Pre-release Version Format:**
```
major.minor.hotfix-beta.betahotfix
```

**Examples:**
- Stable release: `1.2.3`
- Pre-release: `1.3.0-beta.1`
- Beta hotfix: `1.3.0-beta.2`

<Note>
  - **Major version** - Incremented on breaking changes
  - **Minor version** - Incremented on new features, bugfixes, and backwards-compatible changes  
  - **Hotfix version** - Incremented only when backporting bugfixes to releases
</Note>

### Docker Files and Helm Charts

Changes to Docker files and Helm charts increment the version numbers in their respective files.

## Release Schedule

Onyx follows a predictable weekly release cycle.

**Every Monday:**
1. The last pre-release version is promoted to stable
2. `main` is frozen as the new pre-release

### Hotfix Process

- Critical bug fixes are **backported** to stable releases as necessary
- Hotfixes bypass the normal weekly cycle for urgent production issues
- Both stable and pre-release branches receive hotfixes when applicable


## Deployment Best Practices

Monitor the `/api/versions` endpoint to automate deployment workflows. 

Stay tuned to our Github and join our [Slack](/deployment/miscellaneous/contact_us) to stay informed about new releases and breaking changes. 

Choose the right version for your deployment environment:
<Info>
  - **Production environments** - Use stable releases only
  - **Staging/testing environments** - Use pre-release versions to validate upcoming changes
  - **Development environments** - Contributors should fork from `main`
