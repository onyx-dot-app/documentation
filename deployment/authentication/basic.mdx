Basic Auth is the easiest way to get started with Onyx. However, we recommend using Google OAuth, OIDC, or SAML for production deployments.

<Tip>
  If you have questions about which authentication approach is best for your organization, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://docs.onyx.app/contact_us) - we're happy to help you choose the right solution.

## Basic Setup

**Using Docker:**

In your `.env` file, set:

```bash
AUTH_TYPE=basic
```

**Using Helm:**

In your `values.yaml` file, set:

```yaml
configMap: 
  AUTH_TYPE: basic
```
If you don't need email verification, you're done!

Restart Onyx to apply the changes and the next time you visit the site, you'll be prompted to create an account and set a password.

## Basic Auth with Email Verification

Enabling email verification blocks your users from signing in until they click their verification email.

**Using Docker:**

Set the following in your `.env` file:

```bash
AUTH_TYPE=basic

# Enable email verification
REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true

# Email configuration
SMTP_USER=<EMAIL_TO_SEND_VERIFICATION_EMAILS_FROM>  # e.g. noreply@yourcompany.com
SMTP_PASS=<PASSWORD_FOR_THE_EMAIL_ABOVE>

# Required for non-Gmail accounts
SMTP_SERVER=<YOUR_SMTP_SERVER>
SMTP_PORT=<PORT_YOUR_SMTP_SERVER_LISTENS_ON>  # default: 587
```

**Using Helm:**

Set the following in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
auth:
  secrets:
      smpt_pass: <PASSWORD_FOR_THE_SMTP_USER>
configMap: 
  AUTH_TYPE: basic
  
  REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION: true
  SMTP_USER: <EMAIL_TO_SEND_VERIFICATION_EMAILS_FROM>

  # Required for non-Gmail accounts
  SMTP_SERVER: <YOUR_SMTP_SERVER>
  SMTP_PORT: <PORT_YOUR_SMTP_SERVER_LISTENS_ON>
```
