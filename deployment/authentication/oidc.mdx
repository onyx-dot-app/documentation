Configure Onyx with OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication to integrate with enterprise identity providers. OIDC provides secure, standardized authentication that works with popular identity providers like Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Auth0, and more.

<Info>
**Enterprise Feature**

OIDC authentication is available as part of the Onyx Enterprise Edition. This provides enhanced security, compliance features, and enterprise-grade identity integration.

[Contact us](https://docs.onyx.app/contact_us) to discuss Enterprise Edition features and setup assistance.

## What is OIDC?

OpenID Connect is a modern authentication protocol built on OAuth 2.0 that provides:

- **Standardized Authentication**: Industry-standard protocol supported by major identity providers
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users authenticate once and access multiple applications
- **Secure Token Exchange**: Uses JWT tokens for secure identity verification
- **User Profile Access**: Retrieve user information from the identity provider
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with various OIDC-compliant identity providers

## Supported Identity Providers

Onyx OIDC integration works with any OIDC-compliant identity provider, including:

### **Popular Enterprise Providers**
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** - Full enterprise integration with Microsoft ecosystem
- **Okta** - Comprehensive identity and access management platform
- **Auth0** - Developer-friendly authentication service
- **Google Workspace** - Google's enterprise identity solution
- **Ping Identity** - Enterprise identity and access management
- **OneLogin** - Cloud-based identity and access management
- **Keycloak** - Open-source identity and access management solution

### **Cloud Provider Solutions**
- **AWS Cognito** - Amazon's managed authentication service
- **Firebase Auth** - Google's mobile and web authentication
- **Azure Active Directory B2C** - Customer identity access management

## Enterprise Benefits

### **Security and Compliance**
- **Centralized Authentication**: Manage all user access through your existing identity provider
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Leverage your IdP's MFA capabilities
- **Compliance Standards**: Meet requirements for SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of authentication events
- **Risk-Based Authentication**: Advanced security features from enterprise IdPs

### **User Experience**
- **Single Sign-On**: Users access Onyx using their existing corporate credentials
- **Automatic Provisioning**: Users are automatically created and updated based on IdP data
- **Role Mapping**: Map IdP groups/roles to Onyx permissions automatically
- **Session Management**: Centralized session control and timeout policies

### **Administrative Efficiency**
- **Centralized User Management**: Manage Onyx access through your existing identity system
- **Automated Onboarding/Offboarding**: Users gain/lose access based on IdP changes
- **Group-Based Permissions**: Leverage existing organizational structure for access control
- **Reduced IT Overhead**: Minimize password management and user support requests

## Configuration Overview

Setting up OIDC with Onyx involves:

1. **Identity Provider Configuration**:
   - Register Onyx as an application in your IdP
   - Configure redirect URIs and scopes
   - Obtain client credentials and discovery endpoints

2. **Onyx Configuration**:
   - Set OIDC-specific environment variables
   - Configure user attribute mapping
   - Set up role and group mappings

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test authentication flow with various user accounts
   - Verify user provisioning and role assignments
   - Validate SSO experience across your organization

## Common Configuration Parameters

While specific setup varies by identity provider, common OIDC configuration includes:

```bash
# Authentication type
AUTH_TYPE=oidc

# OIDC Provider Configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your_oidc_client_id
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oidc_client_secret
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://your-idp.com/.well-known/openid_configuration
OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-onyx-domain.com/auth/oidc/callback

# User Attribute Mapping
OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM=preferred_username
OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM=email
OIDC_NAME_CLAIM=name

# Optional: Group/Role Mapping
OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM=groups
OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS=onyx-admins,it-staff
```

## Provider-Specific Considerations

### **Microsoft Entra ID**
- Supports both single-tenant and multi-tenant configurations
- Can integrate with on-premises Active Directory via Azure AD Connect
- Provides conditional access policies and advanced security features
- Supports application roles for fine-grained access control

### **Okta**
- Comprehensive user lifecycle management
- Advanced MFA options including biometric authentication  
- Extensive integration ecosystem with other business applications
- Detailed analytics and reporting capabilities

### **Auth0**
- Developer-friendly configuration interface
- Support for social login providers alongside enterprise authentication
- Advanced customization options for login flows
- Built-in anomaly detection and security features

## Getting Started

To implement OIDC authentication for your organization:

1. **Assessment**: We'll help assess your current identity infrastructure and requirements
2. **Planning**: Develop an implementation plan that minimizes disruption
3. **Configuration**: Our team will configure both your IdP and Onyx for optimal integration
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with your user groups before go-live
5. **Migration**: Smooth transition from existing authentication methods
6. **Support**: Ongoing support for any issues or configuration changes

## Security Best Practices

When implementing OIDC authentication:

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use encrypted connections for all OIDC endpoints
- **Validate Tokens**: Properly validate JWT tokens and signatures
- **Secure Storage**: Store client secrets securely using environment variables or secret management
- **Regular Rotation**: Rotate client secrets and certificates regularly
- **Monitor Access**: Implement logging and monitoring for authentication events
- **Test Security**: Regular security testing and penetration testing

## Custom Integrations

For organizations with custom or less common identity providers:

- **Custom OIDC Implementations**: We can work with your team to integrate with custom IdPs
- **Legacy System Integration**: Bridge legacy authentication systems with modern OIDC
- **Hybrid Authentication**: Support multiple authentication methods during migration periods
- **Custom Claims**: Map custom user attributes and claims to Onyx user profiles

## Migration Support

Transitioning to OIDC authentication:

- **User Data Migration**: Preserve existing user data and preferences during migration
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phase implementation across user groups to minimize disruption
- **Fallback Authentication**: Maintain backup authentication methods during transition
- **User Training**: Provide training materials and support for the new authentication flow
