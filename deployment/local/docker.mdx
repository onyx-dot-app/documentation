## Guide

**Note:** On Windows, the commands will be slightly different but all the steps are the same.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Requirements">
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [Docker (with compose)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the Onyx repo">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the compose files">
    ```bash
    cd onyx/deployment/docker_compose
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch Onyx">
    To pull images from Docker Hub and start Onyx:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    Recommended to use `-d` to run in detached mode.

    > Alternatively, to build images from source:
    > ```bash
    > docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
    > ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

After the containers come up, the system needs to go through an initialization process after which you can access Onyx at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).
