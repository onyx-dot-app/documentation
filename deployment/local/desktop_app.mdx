## Installation Options

**Self-hosted users**: On first launch, users will need to configure the connection to your Onyx instance:

- **Server URL**: Your Onyx instance URL (e.g., `https://onyx.yourcompany.com`)
- **Authentication**: Sign in with your configured authentication method

<Note>
  The desktop app will remember the server URL after initial configuration. Users only need to authenticate on subsequent launches if their session expires.
</Note>

## Enterprise Deployment

For organizations deploying the desktop app at scale, you can pre-configure the connection settings.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `server_url` | Your Onyx instance URL |
| `window_title` | Custom window title |
