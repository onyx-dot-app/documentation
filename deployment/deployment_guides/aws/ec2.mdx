Using AWS EC2 is the recommended way of deploying Onyx. 
It is simple to set up and should meet the performance needs of 90% of organizations looking to use Onyx!

## Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an EC2 instance">
        Create an EC2 instance with the appropriate resources. For this guide, we will use the recommended `m7g.xlarge` instance.
        <Note>
            Read our [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing) for more details.
        </Note>

        - Give your instance a descriptive name like `onyx-prod`
        - Select the `Amazon Linux 2023` AMI
        - Select the `64-bit (Arm)` architecture
        - Select the `m7g.xlarge` instance type
        - Select `Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet` in the *Network settings* section
        - Configure storage following the Resourcing Guide

  <Step title="Install Onyx requirements">
    Onyx requires `git`, `docker`, and `docker compose`. 
    
    To install these on Amazon Linux 2023, run the following:

    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y

    sudo yum install docker -y
    sudo service docker start

    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

    sudo yum install git
    ```
