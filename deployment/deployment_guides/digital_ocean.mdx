<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Droplet">
        Create a Droplet with the appropriate resources. For this guide, we will use a recommended configuration with Docker pre-installed.
        <Note>
            Read our [Resourcing guide](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing) for more details.
        </Note>

        - Give your Droplet a descriptive name like `onyx-prod`
        - Select a region close to your users
        - Select the `Docker` image from the *Marketplace* tab
        - Choose a Droplet size with at least 4 vCPUs and 16GB RAM
        - Configure storage following the Resourcing Guide
        - Add your SSH key for secure access
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create the Droplet">
        Click **Create Droplet** and then view your Droplet details.
        
        <Tip>
            Save the **Public IP address** of the Droplet!
        </Tip>

    <Step title="Install Onyx requirements">
        Since we selected the Docker Marketplace image, Docker and Docker Compose are already installed.
        
        We just need to install `git`:

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y git
        ```
