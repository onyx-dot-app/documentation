openapi: "GET /versions"

Fetches the latest stable and beta versions of Onyx Docker images.

Since DockerHub does not explicitly flag stable and beta images, this endpoint can be used to programmatically check for new images.

## Response

Returns version information for both stable and beta releases of Onyx Docker images.

## Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://cloud.onyx.app/api/versions"
```

This endpoint is useful for:
- Automated deployment scripts that need to check for new versions
- Monitoring systems that track available updates
- CI/CD pipelines that deploy the latest stable or beta versions
