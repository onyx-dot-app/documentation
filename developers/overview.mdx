**Nearly every Onyx feature is accessible through the Onyx API.**

Onyx APIs are built on REST principles with JSON request/response formats. All endpoints require authentication and follow relatively consistent patterns.

Make API requests to:

`https://cloud.onyx.app/api` or `https://your-self-hosted-onyx.com/api`

<Note>
  Onyx follows [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes will be indicated by major version increments.
</Note>

## Authentication
To authenticate your requests, generate an API key from the Onyx Admin Console.

There are three types of API keys:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Admin API Keys" icon="shield-check">
    Can access all endpoints, including those pre-fixed with `admin/`.
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Full system administration
    - User management operations
    - Data management and analytics
    - Complete access to all Onyx features
    
    **⚠️ Use with caution:** Admin keys have unrestricted access to your Onyx instance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Basic API Keys" icon="key">
    Can access the non-admin endpoints like Search, Chat, Agents, and Actions.
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Building chat applications
    - Implementing search functionality
    - Creating and managing assistants
    - Running actions and workflows
    
    **✅ Recommended:** Most users should use Basic API Keys for application development.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limited API Keys" icon="lock">
    Read-only Assistant access. Can post messages to Chat endpoints, but cannot read chat history.
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Highly restricted environments
    - Specific use cases requiring minimal permissions
    - Testing with limited scope
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Coming soon:** User-Scoped Token tied to a specific user's permissions and data access.
</Info>

API Keys exist as distinct users in Onyx. This means:
- You can trace activity to a specific API Key
- Chat sessions generated by API will be private and re-useable with that API Key
- Assistants, Connectors, and Document Sets can be configured to be private to that API Key

## API Reference and Playground

In the [API Reference](/developers/api_reference/chat/get_chat_session), we have curated a subset of useful Onyx API endpoints. 
You can experiment with the endpoints on each page or follow one of our [Guides](/developers/guides/chat_guide).

You can find all Onyx API endpoints in the built-in OpenAPI explorer:

`https://cloud.onyx.app/api/docs` or `https://your-onyx-domain.com/api/docs`

<Warning>
  The explorer is purely for reference. It is not a fully-featured API client. 
  Ignore the tenant_id parameter and use your API key as a Bearer token.
</Warning>
