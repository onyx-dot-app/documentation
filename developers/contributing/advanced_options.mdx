# Advanced Options

These documentation pages provide a curated overview of the most commonly used APIs and development workflows. However, they are **not exhaustive**.

## Complete API Reference

For a comprehensive and exhaustive API reference with all available endpoints, parameters, and schemas, please visit:

**`https://your-onyx-instance.com/api/docs`**

Replace `your-onyx-instance.com` with your actual Onyx base URL (e.g., `https://cloud.onyx.app/api/docs` for Onyx Cloud).

<Note>
**Important**: The API sandbox functionality in the exhaustive reference may not work properly. For testing API endpoints, we recommend using **Postman** or other API testing tools with your actual API credentials.
</Note>

## Testing APIs

To test the API endpoints:

1. **Use Postman** or similar tools (curl, Insomnia, etc.)
2. Set up your authentication headers (API key or session cookies)
3. Reference the complete API documentation at `/api/docs` for all available parameters
4. Test against your actual Onyx instance URL

The exhaustive reference includes all endpoints, request/response schemas, and detailed parameter descriptions that may not be covered in these developer documentation pages.
