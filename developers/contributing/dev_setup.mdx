# Development Setup

This guide will help you set up your development environment to contribute to Onyx.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Required for running Onyx services
- **Python 3.11+** - For backend development
- **Node.js 18+** - For frontend development
- **Git** - For version control

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/onyx.git
cd onyx

# Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git
```

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your preferred settings
# Most defaults should work for development
```

### 3. Start Development Environment

```bash
# Start the full development stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Or start individual services as needed
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up postgres redis vespa
```

### 4. Backend Development

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements/default.txt
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the backend server
uvicorn onyx.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

### 5. Frontend Development

```bash
# Navigate to web directory
cd web

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd backend && python -m pytest

   # Frontend tests
   cd web && npm test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

### Code Quality

- **Backend**: We use `black`, `isort`, and `mypy` for code formatting and type checking
- **Frontend**: We use `eslint` and `prettier` for code formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Install with `pre-commit install` to automatically run checks

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for new functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and database interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test user workflows end-to-end

## Architecture Overview

Understanding Onyx's architecture will help you contribute effectively:

- **Backend**: FastAPI Python application
- **Frontend**: Next.js React application  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for application data
- **Vector Database**: Vespa for document embeddings
- **Cache**: Redis for session management
- **Background Tasks**: Celery for document processing

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Connector

See the [Connectors guide](/contributing/connectors) for detailed instructions.

### Creating Custom Actions

See the [Actions guide](/contributing/actions) for detailed instructions.

### Working with Agents

See the [Agents guide](/contributing/agents) for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts**: Make sure ports 3000, 8080, 5432, 6379, and 8081 are available.

**Docker issues**: Try `docker system prune` to clean up old containers and images.

**Database issues**: Run `docker compose down -v` to reset the database volume.

**Permission issues**: Make sure your user has permission to run Docker commands.
