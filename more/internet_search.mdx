### How it works

The Internet Search action uses the [Exa](https://exa.ai) API to search the web. Assistants equipped with Internet Search will analyze web results to answer your questions.


Currently, Exa is the only supported provider. 
If you would like to use or contribute a new provider, please let us know in our [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/onyx-dot-app/shared_invite/zt-34lu4m7xg-TsKGO6h8PDvR5W27zTdyhA).

### Setup

- **Onyx Cloud**: Internet Search is available by default! Skip to [Usage](#usage).

- **Self-hosted**: To use Internet Search, you'll need to create an account with [Exa](https://exa.ai), generate an API key, and add a new `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable to your Onyx deployment.

### Usage

Once you have your Exa API key set, you can set up your assistants with Internet Search.

On the assistant creation or update page, tick the "Internet Search" checkbox (see [Assistants Overview](/guides/assistants/overview) for more details).

Your assistant will analyze your query and determine whether or not to use Internet Search. Your results will be displayed just like internal Search results.
